There are new discoveries that come out," he said.</p><h2>HIGH PRICED SALES</h2><p>GreatCollections has had some impressive sales in the last few years.</p><p>Recently, a <a href=#>collection of Lincoln pennies</a> sold for $7.7million after Stewart Blay, a numismatist and a sculptor, passed away.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>This was huge for the auction site as Ian said the last record for a Lincoln cent collection was likely less than a million dollars.</p><p>“The collection is probably the most striking realization because the coins are so modern and nothing has ever come close to it,” Ian said.</p><p>Just one of the coins, the 1958 Lincoln cent, was so rare and valuable due to its severe doubling on some of the lettering.</p><p>This particular penny sold for a record $1,136,250 after 117 bids.</p><p>The site also handled the private sale of America’s first silver dollar which was sold for $12million.</p><p>Rare coin experts believe that this is the first silver dollar ever struck by the United States Mint - which led to its high price.</p><p>Ian has also seen two 1913 nickels - both valued at over $4million.</p><p>In fact, one of them was worth $4.2million as there are only three in private hands and only five were minted.</p><p>The obverse on the 1913 Liberty Head Nickel features Lady Liberty wearing a crown with stars above her head.</p><p>While the reverse showcases a large V in the middle which is also why it's known as the V nickel.</p><p>This coin is so valuable because of its error - the U.S. Mint forgot to place the word CENTS on it making it ripe for scammers to pass them off as higher values.</p><h2>THE BIG THREE</h2><p>Back in 2021, GreatCollections acquired three coins that each set a record in price.</p><p>Dubbed the big three, the total price was $13.35million and was completed on Thanksgiving.</p><p>The coins were:</p><ul><li>1913 Liberty Head Nickel graded PCGS Proof-66 CAC</li><li>1894-S Proof Barber Dime graded PCGS Proof-65+ CAC</li><li>1804 Silver Dollar graded PCGS Proof-65</li></ul><p>Collector Bruce Morelan owned the coins and acquired them individually over the past years.</p><p>Only a few collectors over the past century have owned all three, including Louis Eliasberg, Col. E.H.R. Green, Dr. Jerry Buss, and Bruce Morelan.</p><p>“This record-breaking deal was consummated in less than 24 hours, after a 10-minute conversation with Laura on the day before Thanksgiving," Ian said.</p><p>The value of those coins can be attributed to their high grade and low mintage.</p><h2>COLLECTING FOR BEGINNERS</h2><p>For those looking to start collecting or selling, Ian recommended starting small.</p><p>“The highest end of the numismatic market is not the normal part of the market,” Ian said.</p><p>This means looking for coins that are available for $100, $300, $500, or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Consider an 1880s Morgan silver dollar that contains a little over three-quarters of an ounce of silver in uncirculated condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Ian said collectors can buy those points for around $60 and you’re getting a piece of history.</p><p>While they're not necessarily rare because they're plentiful, the value of the coins has actually performed quite well over the last 20 years.</p><p>Another series of coins to collect is called the seated Liberty series, which was produced in the 1919 century prior to the Morgan dollars.</p><p>Modern coins are a great collector's item also.</p><p>In 2021, the U.S. Mint produced Morgan and Peace Silver Dollars.</p><p>As the Morgan dollar stopped being minted in 1921, these marked the 100th anniversary of its last year.</p><p>It also marked the first year of minting of the Peace Dollar.</p><p>The coins come in a set but Ian said some folks bought just one of the coins for around the $100 mark but are now worth over $1,000 due to condition and demand.</p><p>"We had clients that bought 10 coins from demand and maybe five of them graded 70 and $1,000 silver coins now,” Ian said.</p><h2>BUYING AND SELLING TIPS</h2><p>When it comes to buying and selling, there are a few things to consider.</p><p>Firstly, make sure that you get your coin graded and appraised - even if it is of low value.</p><p>This will ensure that what you have is indeed valuable and is an indicator to other buyers that you are legitimate.</p><p>Plus, grading your coin by a third party may even help you with pricing your coin higher.</p><p>Another important tip is to do your research.</p><p>This includes buying from reputable sources, learning market values, and understanding any risks when buying.</p><p>One of the biggest risks new collectors make is thinking they are getting a great deal.</p><p>This is why understanding prices and what makes coins valuable is so important.</p><h2>OTHER COIN SITES</h2><p>While GreatCollections offers a variety of coins and other valuables, there are plenty of other sites to check out.</p><p><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heritage Auctions</a> is another major player in the collectible game and has thousands of items up for auction on a daily basis.</p><p>Much like GreatCollections, some of the items from Heritage Auction have recently sold for record prices.</p><p>This includes an 1870-S Three Dollar Gold <a aria-label="which sold (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which sold</a> for an impressive $5.5million due to its rarity.</p><p>Another great site is <a aria-label="Stack’s Bowers (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stack’s Bowers</a> as it is known for its rare coins.</p><p>The company has been around for nearly one century and includes a catalog and sales of some of the most valuable U.S. coin and currency collections.</p><h2>WHAT MAKES A COIN VALUABLE?</h2><p>While grades and errors are among the popular factors to determine a coin’s worth, the U.S. Mint can also add value.</p><p>Rarity is a nice selling point for collectors so pricing may come down to how many are produced.</p><p>Sometimes, if the Mint produces too many coins, it will get criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, it will also get criticized for underproducing.&nbsp;</p><p>More often than not, if one coin sells out too quickly, the next issue the Mint will likely produce too many.</p><p>For example, Ian said the Mint got it right in 2021 when it produced the Morgan and Peace Silver Dollars.</p><p>Ian feels these coins have the right mintage as their price has gone up around the world.</p><p>“It's a very fine line, they have to predict in advance. I used to say that whatever they will do, it'll be a mistake,” Ian said.</p><h2>THE AUCTION PROCESS</h2><p>GreatCollections was started as a way to improve how coins and paper money are sold at auction.</p><p>Collectors can buy and sell at many places and platforms, but very few ensure safe transactions while keeping both parties confidential.</p><p>The company has weekly auctions where bidders can purchase tons of certified coins.</p><p>"They range in value from $20, $50, right up to coins worth $1million or more and everywhere in between," Ian said.</p><p>GreatCollections deals with thousands of collectors every month, either in bidding or in consigning.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The U.S. Sun revealed the <a href=#>exact details</a> to look for to find rare pennies.</p><p>Plus, a rare <a href=#>$2 bill sold</a> for over $19,000 due to a specific doubling error.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIF5g5Brb2ibn567brHXqZyrrF2dtqi0jKmpopuVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
