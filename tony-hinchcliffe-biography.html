Gay guys treat me like I’m a hot chick,” back in 2011.</p><p>Since then, many have believed that he is gay. Moreover, his mannerisms and behavior have also added to the speculations about his sexuality.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hot chicks treat me like I'm a gay guy.

However, this is not true.</p><p>The comedian is not gay but is straight. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was married</a> to his wife, Charlotte Jane, in 2015. Details of his personal life are unknown, but the pair allegedly got married, and Hinchcliffe called her his wife on his podcast.</p><p>At the time of writing, it is unknown if the duo are still together. This is because Jane has been posting pictures with another man, calling herself the luckiest girl in the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tony Hinchcliffe’s career and net worth</h2><p>Hinchcliffe relocated to Los Angeles in 2007 to pursue a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">career</a> in comedy, appearing at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood.

His razor-sharp style and ability to captivate audiences with challenging topics have won him a cult following.</p><p>Hinchcliffe has appeared on several comedy specials, television shows, and podcasts during his career, demonstrating his flexibility as a comedian and performer. His humor and gutsy approach to comedy have earned him critical recognition as well as financial success in the comedy industry, elevating him to a prominent figure in the stand-up comedy scene.</p><p>To date, he has never revealed his net worth. However, various tabloids have reported it to be various numbers.</p><p>Summarizing those numbers, we can say that Hinchcliffe’s net worth is at least seven figures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tony Hinchcliffe’s age, height, weight</h2><p>At the time of writing, Hinchcliffe’s age is 39. He was born on June 8, 1984, in Youngstown, Ohio, USA, and celebrated his 39th birthday in 2023.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Talking about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">height</a>, Hinchcliffe is roughly 170 centimeters tall, which equates to 5 feet 7 inches. His height is considered average, positioning him in the middle of the adult male height range.</p><p>Hinchcliffe’s weight is roughly 68 kilograms or around 149 pounds.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tony Hinchcliffe’s parents and family</h2><p>Hinchcliffe had a difficult childhood. In the name of family, all he had was his mother.</p><p>He did not have any siblings, and it looks like his dad was not in the picture. So, his single mother raised him in the north side of Youngstown, Ohio.&nbsp;</p><p>His mother wanted him to be decent when he was younger, so he was enrolled in Ursuline High School. He claimed that he grew up in a difficult neighborhood with gangs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He was bullied and even beaten by them, so he resolved to learn ways to protect himself. Regardless, his roasts were occasionally so savage that he was hit, as at his school, so he had to have his wits about him.</p><p>As a result, he began to make friends with other individuals who were bullied yet had the ability to make others laugh. He also discovered his talent for humor and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">roasting</a>, which proved to be a watershed moment in his life.</p><p>Talking about his dad, Hinchcliffe said on Instagram that he taught his Italian father how to take a selfie. He has not determined if the individual is his biological dad or if the father adopted him.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hypothesis</a> is that the title “Dad” is a figure of speech used to express respect for the person who may have cared for him. In 2022, on episode 44 of The HoneyDew podcast, Hinchcliffe revealed that his biological dad lived across the street from them.&nbsp;</p><p>He said that his dad used to visit him, and he recognized the car, hence connecting the dots that his dad was their neighbor. He confronted his mother, and there was chaos that followed.</p><p>However, it is unknown if the story about his parents is actually true or if it is merely a comedic routine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tony Hinchcliffe getting canceled</h2><p>In 2021, Hinchcliffe was canceled for using racial slurs against fellow comedian, Peng Dang.</p><p>In May 2021, Hinchcliffe was caught on film disrespecting Dang, an Asian American comedian who had introduced Hinchcliffe following his earlier show at Austin’s Vulcan Gas Company.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Hinchcliffe called Dang various racial slurs and then launched into a series of Asian clichés in a mimic Chinese accent, labeling audience members who smiled at Dang’s jokes as “race traitors.”&nbsp;</p><p>The video was eventually shared on Twitter by Dang, where it quickly went viral and people demanded Hinchcliffe get canceled.</p><p>As a consequence, Hinchcliffe’s agency WME dropped him, he was pulled from Rogan’s gigs in Austin, and the Austin nightclub Antones declared that it would no longer be connected with Hinchcliffe or his Kill Tony live act.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vulture</a>, during his show, Hinchcliffe suggested that Chinese people traveled to Austin for the bats and chastised angry audience members for believing he was serious. Dang reported that he did not get an apology from Hinchcliffe as a result of the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9OopbJlmJ67pLTCpaCfnpVir6q7xquYqaCpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
