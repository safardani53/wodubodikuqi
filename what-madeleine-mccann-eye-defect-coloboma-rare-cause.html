It's not a computer glitch - the black spot in Madeleine's iris is actually due to a rare condition called coloboma, which only effects one in every 10,000 births."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It's always the case that the condition is visible, however.</p><p>The rare condition can't be cured - but is monitored with six-monthly and then yearly eye checks.</p><p>Some children with coloboma may need to wear glasses, and adults can get cosmetic contact lenses to make the pupil look round.</p><p>Prescription sunglasses are sometimes advised, because of the light sensitivity.</p><p>Children who have coloboma in only one eye may need to wear an eye patch or use special eye drops to prevent the development of a lazy eye.</p><p>Surgery to make the pupils look rounder is also an option.</p><h2>Where did Madeleine McCann go missing?</h2><p>Little <a href=#>Maddie</a>, then three,&nbsp;<a href=#>disappeared from her bed</a>&nbsp;in a holiday apartment in Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, <a href=#>Praia da Luz</a>, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal.</p><p><a href=#>The McCanns</a> arrived on Saturday, April 28, 2007, for a seven-night spring break at the two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment.</p><p>It was in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village.</p><p>But on the evening of May 3, the little girl vanished from the apartment where she had been sleeping with her brother and sister.</p><p>Her parents were at a nearby restaurant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaIFzgpNta2ivmJbBbrnAnZylnZmjsm65wpyYp6ZdmsamecOenZ6bpGKwsLjOm6ammV2nrrOxjJyYrquVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
