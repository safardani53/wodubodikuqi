Family &amp;amp; Age</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-02</div><p><strong>Renee Blank, Lance Blank’s wife</strong>, is devastated by her husband’s death. Here is what we know about their marriage and family life. Lance Blanks was a former professional basketball player and executive from the United States. He worked as an ESPN commentator. Blanks was a point guard/shooting guard throughout his professional career.</p><p>Lance was also a member of a number of teams throughout his professional career, including the Detroit Pistons, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Albacomp Fehérvár. Between 2010 to 2013, he was the general manager of the Phoenix Suns after retiring from playing. Blanks was an analyst for the Texas Longhorns on Longhorn Network until his death.&nbsp;The whole globe is presently grieving Blanks’ death, which occurred on May 3, 2023, although the family has not disclosed the reason for death.</p><h2>Renee Blank, Lance Blank’s wife: Was He Engaged?</h2><p><strong>Lance Blanks</strong> seems to be a married guy, since his wife, Renee, survives him. Their wedding plans are similarly shrouded in mystery. They have both avoided the spotlight and kept their personal lives private.&nbsp;Because of their private nature, no media sources have been allowed to report specifics of their wedding. Because no media outlets have revealed any information, it is safe to assume that they were just in a relationship. Despite this, they had already begun their own family. Lance Blanks died at age 56, shattering the whole Blanks family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lance-Blanks-1.jpg alt="Lance Blanks" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Meet the Lance Blanks Children. Bryn and Riley</h2><p>Lance and Renee Blanks were the delighted parents of two children, Riley and Bryn. Riley is said to be the creator of Woke Beauty. Riley was a four-star recruit for the University of Virginia tennis team, thus she seems to be active in sports.&nbsp;She’s also competed in the Copper Bowl Junior and the US Tennis Association Super National Winter Championships. Riley has won various competitions due to her involvement, including the Super Nationals consolation final. Riley had a close relationship with her father, who also coached her.&nbsp;Details on Bryn Lance, on the other hand, are unknown. As a result, it is impossible to say what she is doing.</p><h2>A View Into Lance Blank’s Family Life</h2><p>Lance Blanks was born on September 9, 1966, in Del Rio, Texas, to Sid Blanks (Father) and Clarice (Mother). He was reared in an athletic household since some of her family members were athletes. Sid, his father, was an American football player. Sid was also the first African American football player at LSC.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Lance-Blanks-2.jpg alt="Lance Blanks" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>From 1964 through 1968, he was a member of the AFL’s Houston Oilers. Meanwhile, Sid died on December 12, 2021, at the age of 80, in Webster, Texas. Lance’s cousin, Larvell Blanks, is a former professional baseball player in the United States. Lance also has a younger brother called Sidney Jr.&nbsp;We, the Genius Celebs crew, also pay our respects to the late soul and extend our condolences to the bereaved family and friends.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmqaTmnqjuMCnoqxlp56zpnnDqJysZZiaeqmt1Z5kmqapYriqsIyfmKahnK56orPEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
