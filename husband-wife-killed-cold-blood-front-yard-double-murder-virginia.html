Ed O'Carroll, bureau chief of Major Crimes Cyber and Forensics for Fairfax County police, said the 911 call came at about 9:20 a.m. and the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene. He identified the victims as Edward McDaniel Jr., 55, and Brenda McDaniel, 63, of Springfield, Virginia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They did nothing wrong," said O'Carroll, asking for local residents to help identify the confirmed vehicle the suspect or suspects used to flee the scene: a light-colored 2018 Nissan Altima.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O'Carroll explained that authorities believe Wednesday's murders are likely connected to an attempted burglary that was reported Monday at the McDaniel residence. The investigation is ongoing, and the motive is unclear, though he said, "I think there's a direct correlation between who was there Monday and who was there today."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
