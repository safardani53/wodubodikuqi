The 43-year-old star of Jackass, Wildboyz and Dr. Steve-O is lucky to be alive, as he suffered what looks to be first and second degree burns after pulling off a stunt for an upcoming comedy special. In a video released to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>, Steve-O’s arms and chest are covered in these stomach-churning blisters, some of which are visibly filled with liquid. It’s really gross to watch. After seeing these injuries, it’s obvious just how dangerous his stunt really was.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So what did Steve-O do to injure himself so badly? “You know what I did?” Steve-O said in “Don’t Be A Dick – Part 2,” a video he uploaded to his YouTube account (also, don’t watch that if you have a weak stomach.) “When you haul out a rocket engine? The rocket engine fuel…if you take that powder, it shoots out a full flash explosion.” Steve-O said that for the grand finale of his special, he did a bunch of “dumb stunts” that pretty came close to burning him alive. “I put a teacup full of the stuff on top of my head and I just f*cking put a blanket of the sh*t on the floor and f*cking laid in it. I was making snow angels with rocket engine fuel.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Steve-O told TMZ that this comedy special was his attempt of “marrying all my different worlds all together in one thing.” Though Steve-O is known for his repulsive and outrageous stunts, he’s actually a professionally trained clown, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Irish Examiner</a>. He graduated from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum Bailey Clown College in 1997, three years before he joined <strong>Johnny Knoxville</strong>, 46,<strong> Jeff Tremaine</strong>, 50, and the rest of the Jackass crew to create the worldwide phenomenon. By the way: Jeff is the director behind this new comedy special, so while&nbsp;Jackass is off the air, its spirit still lives on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>His first stand-up special, Guilty As Charged<strong>, </strong>saw him get tazed with 50,000 volts, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Uproxx.</a>&nbsp;It sounds like he wanted to top that stunt with something that came close to burning him to death. Steve-O says that after he’s done doing “fire angels,” he reveals the “true motivation” that ties it all together, though viewers might be left with a different impression. “If anybody ever thought I was a gnarly crazy guy before,” he told TMZ, “They are going to be ‘whoa, I didn’t realize he was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that gnarly and crazy</a>.'” Yeah, no need to worry about that, Steve-O. Everyone thinks you’re pretty damn gnarly and crazy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Are you going to watch Steve-O’s new special, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Do you think he should continue to play with fire?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH14e49wZqyslauybruMm6yrppWZerTA1KerZqqfmLimwIyfrJ6kXZ%2BupLfArKpmoZ6fwrOxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
