So, I mean, fans have gotten bigger movies made.”</p><p>That same year, Bledel, 42, even revealed that the women have “pitched a third movie,” sharing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that it would be “so great” if the stars aligned and they could work together again.</p><p>As for why it’s taken so long? Tamblyn noted that it’s a “complicated” task getting everyone in the same place at the same time.</p><p>“Just the fact that between the four of us, we all have <a href=#>like 870 children</a>, so you know, it’s hard,” she joked on SiriusXM’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Pop Culture Spotlight</a> in October 2022. (She shares one child with husband <strong>David Cross</strong>. Lively has welcomed four kids with husband <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>. Ferrera and husband <strong>Ryan Piers Williams</strong> share two kids. Bledel has one son with ex-husband <strong>Vincent Kartheiser</strong>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite their busy schedules, Tamblyn said they’re definitely down to do something in the future.</p><p>“I know that that is a great hope for all four of us is to be able to work together again,” she added. “I mean, that’s, to me, it feels like the ultimate grift where I’m like, ‘Wait a minute, we’re gonna get paid to hang out when we do that in real life anyway? Cool. I’m in.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqiq6Sav6m7zp1kqJ5dqbWmedOrmK%2BdnJ67qHnPmqWtq12YrrTAjKucrqaZqbK0ecWoqWarp5qytXnPoaatp18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
