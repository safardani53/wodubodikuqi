Rest In Peace Dad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kendrick said on the podcast that she and her brother had "sort of been prepared" to get a call with the sad news for the past decade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Especially in the last couple of years, there were constantly these updates about his health, and we don't talk about anything. So, you know, there were these very vague but somehow very serious updates happening all the time and we couldn't really read between the lines and figure out what are we talking about," she said. "I would just love a timeline, but we can't really ask those questions."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were always trying to interpret what was happening. And [my brother] and I were talking about how we've sort of been prepared for the call to come at anytime for the last 10 years," continued Kendrick. "Because, again, my dad was larger, he had heart problems in the past, and just generally not a man who kept his health in good order. ... It always was just, 'It could happen at any time.'

I would be in the middle of production going, 'If I need to come home tell me. It will probably blow up this movie because it's a very small movie and they don't have the funding, whatever, but if that's what's happening let me know, I'll go.' It was never clear," said Kendrick.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Anna Kendrick.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Yes, of course, any recovery is wonderful because it means you have more time, but if I could just get a timeline. If it was six months, I know what I'm doing for the next six months. But when it was 'it's probably like two years,' I don't really know what to do. I don't stop living my life for two full years, how do I navigate this?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "Even this summer, I was looking at little places. Do I lease a place so I can just be going home all the time? But then you visit and you're also like, 'Oh, a fraction of what will be lost is already lost.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to his obituary, William's "thirst for knowledge made him an avid reader, and he especially loved world history. He enjoyed traveling, the outdoors, and the theater. He also had a broad and eclectic appreciation of music and studied several foreign languages." He served in the U.S. Navy and spent time as a Federal Air Marshall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0miYp6aRYrimusOroJyjXaS9prrSZqypZZGXvLbAjJ2cmqyYYrynecWaq6GdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
