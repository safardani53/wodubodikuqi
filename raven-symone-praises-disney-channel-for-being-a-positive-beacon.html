“It was my job!

I’d wake up, go to work, go to sleep, wake up and go to work,” the <a href=#>Cheetah Girls</a> star recalled.</p><p>After leaving her cohosting gig on <a href=#>The View</a> in 2016, the Cosby Show alum returned to her Disney Channel roots for a long awaited That’s So Raven reboot, <a href=#>Raven’s Home</a>. When it was first announced that a <a href=#>spinoff was in the works</a>, a Disney executive called her performance in the original sitcom “timeless.”</p><p>“Raven’s brilliant style of fearless comedy was a driving force for Disney Channel’s success around the world,” the network’s <a href=#>statement</a> said at the time. “We now have our eyes on the future with her, and we’re looking forward to telling more stories for a new generation with an adult Raven Baxter raising her young family.”</p><p>In the new series, which <a href=#>premiered in July 2017</a>, the star brings new life to her old character Raven Baxter. Now a divorcée, the character uses her psychic powers to help her be a better mother, business owner and friend.</p><p>“It’s a <a href=#>second edition</a> version to what Raven Baxter would have done. It’s not a revival, but the characters are revived,” the College Road Trip star explained. “Even if she didn’t come back or if I didn’t come back, I would still want to be on the Disney Channel because of the content it puts out for the kids and the conscious effort to continue to grow and stay positive.”</p><p>She continued on, raving about the network’s effort to keep kids’ content upbeat and meaningful, especially in the streaming age.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think they’re listening to who they need to,” she added. “I think they are a <a href=#>positive beacon</a> and they are a great way to know what your children are watching and not worry about it. That’s important nowadays. You know you’re going to get good content when you go to that channel and nothing crazy will pop up.”</p><p>With reporting by Meagan Sargent</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmarpWjerTFzKilnmWgp66qv8SsZJ2ho6OyunnCoZinppWheqe70WaZnqGenHqiec%2BoqqKsmauybq7Empqopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
