Looks like Season 7 is already shaping up to be a drama-filled hot mess express with the usual suspects behind the wheel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Let's meet Chris Leoni.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC Universal</span></figure><p>It's winter, so you know what that means: It's time for another season of <a href=#>Bravo</a>'s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Summer House</a>. This is our favorite place to go for hot drama and lukewarm clothing styles. Looks like Season 7 is already shaping up to be a drama-filled hot mess express with the usual suspects behind the wheel.</p><p>Of course, nothing makes a show more complicated like some new blood. Let's get to know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Leoni</a>, who is sure to bring a little something-something to Summer House.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chris Leoni is coming to 'Summer House'! Who is he?</h2><p>The most important information <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo</a> dropped about Chris Leoni is, he's the only single dude in the house. Will Chris end up wrecking some homes or is he a bit of a <a href=#>Cassanova</a> with a wandering everything? More will be revealed. He hails from Florida by way of a "strict Honduran-Uruguayan" childhood. The most daring people often come from buttoned-up homes, so we have high hopes for Chris's hijinks.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@chris_leoni</a></figure><p>Something that also tells us that Chris might be ready to let loose is the fact that he spent four years in the Marines alongside his brothers, as in his actual brothers. After serving his time, Chris headed for New York in the hopes of pursuing his "passions of photography, <a href=#>modeling</a>, and filmmaking," per Bravo. Judging by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram</a>, Chris certainly loves a camera, so he should fit right into Summer House.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What else do we know about Season 7 of 'Summer House'?</h2><p>In June 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> sadly revealed that Luke, Andrea, and Alex wouldn't be returning for Season 7. Thankfully, Luke isn't going far because they also reported he'll be back for Season 2 of <a href=#>Winter House</a>. "I’m not gonna be on Summer House this year. I’m actually extremely, extremely bummed I’m not gonna be able to spend the summer with them — breaks my heart, but I know they’ll have a good time and we’ll be in touch," he said. It's OK, someone who has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his own maple syrup company</a> has more of a winter vibe anyway.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Luke Gulbranson (@lukegulbranson)</a></p></figure><p>Apart from Chris Leoni, we'll also meet newcomers <a href=#>Samantha Feher</a> and <a href=#>Gabby Prescod</a>. Who knows what the new dynamic will look like, but at least one existing cast member had a great time with the new kids on the block. "I love all new people," <a href=#>Paige</a> told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET Online</a> in July 2022. "I think that whenever any show gets a couple new cast members, it changes up the whole energy. It changes up the dynamic."</p><p>Paige was also not shy about her feelings regarding the lack of <a href=#>Austen Kroll</a> in Season 7. It seems as if everyone had enough Austen when he popped in for an over-the-top weekend in Season 6 that involved a buffet of making out with various cast members. Let's just say if he came back it would be very weird. "I feel like that might be a little bit awkward," Paige told the outlet. Let's hope Season 7 is awkward, but in a good way.</p><p>Summer House airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdJmo56nnp56tMHMppyrZZikwrSx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
