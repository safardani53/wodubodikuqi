This makes no sense.</p><p>"You can go to the supermarket and the corner shop to buy beers but they’re telling us that customers have to pre-order.</p><p>"All it’s done is give us more work to do. We have all these people out front trying to ring the phone.</p><p>"We had a telephone line and a WhatsApp but it was still a mess.</p><p>"So I just ordered a couple of phones off Amazon, got a lead to join the two together and thought: “There we go. I’m complying with the law.”</p><p>Mr Ball complained that pub owners are having to overcome obstacles put in place during the second lockdown in order to keep businesses going.</p><h2>RAPID SERVICE</h2><p>This comes as a loophole was discovered in the Government's newly released lockdown regulations meaning <a href=#>boozers can serve alcohol to go</a> - but only if ordered online, on the phone or even by post before they arrive.</p><p>The original guidance on the new measures had said that all booze sales for takeaway would be banned.</p><p>But the new regulations said that booze - and other food - can be collected if ordered in advance.</p><p>However, <a href=#>they will only be able to do this up to 10pm.</a></p><p>Greg Mulholland, Campaign Director of the Campaign for Pubs said the loophole was "welcome."</p><p>He added: "It just shows the farce of this new system.</p><p>"It's extraordinary that originally they said there would be no sale of alcohol to takeaway.</p><p>"But it is welcome news, as it means many pubs won't have to pour perfectly good draft beer away.</p><p>"It means that people can safely enjoy takeaways, and sensibly enjoy alcohol&nbsp;at home throughout the lockdown, and saving many businesses until they can fully open again."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in UK News</h2></p><p>Addressing those who have criticised the system, the Red Lion and Son's manager said: "Call us on your own phone. We aren’t forcing you to use that system.</p><p>"But to be honest, most people are just laughing – in a good way. We’re just taking the p***. They know how ridiculous this system is."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000619529733.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000619529727.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000619529736.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Drinkers hit the pubs for final fling hours before second national lockdown after panic buyers go wild</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfqrivsdasZmprYWt9cX%2BQaKeuml2ltbC6xGarmqOVlsSixYypoKeso2K5sK%2FKnaawpl2hvLC8x6ijnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
