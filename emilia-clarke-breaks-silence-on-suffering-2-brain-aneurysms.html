Emilia Clarke secretly suffered two terrifying brain aneurysms during the early seasons of Game of Thrones — and she is finally ready to break her silence on the life-threatening ailments.
Clarke, now 32, told The New Yorker in an essay published on Thursday, March 21, that she first knew something was wrong during a workout in February 2011, just weeks after she finishing filming the first season of the HBO hit series."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I reached the toilet, sank to my knees and proceeded to be violently, voluminously ill. Meanwhile, the pain —shooting, stabbing, constricting pain — was getting worse. At some level, I knew what was happening — my brain was damaged.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Emilia-Clarke-Breaks-Silence-on-Suffering-2-Life-Threatening-Brain-Aneurysms.jpg><p>The Me Before You actress was rushed to the hospital via ambulance and was diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, “a life-threatening type of stroke, caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain.” Clarke had to undergo a “minimally invasive” type of brain surgery called “endovascular coiling,” where surgeons sealed off the aneurysm using a wire that was inserted into one of her femoral arteries in her groin.</p><p>“When I woke, the pain was unbearable. I had no idea where I was,” the British star explained. “My field of vision was constricted.”</p><p>While Clarke slowly recovered from the procedure, she later suffered a condition called aphasia, which caused her to forget her name. She noted, “My full name is Emilia Isobel Euphemia Rose Clarke, but now I couldn’t remember it. Instead, nonsense words tumbled out of my mouth and I went into a blind panic. I’d never experienced fear like that — a sense of doom closing in. I could see my life ahead, and it wasn’t worth living. I am an actor; I need to remember my lines. Now I couldn’t recall my name.”</p><p>The <a href=#>former Broadway star</a> admitted that she “asked the medical staff to let [her] die” because she was so frightened that she would never recover fully and therefore couldn’t act. Fortunately, the aphasia passed in a week and she was eventually discharged from the hospital one month after she was admitted.</p><p>Clarke quickly jumped back into filming Game of Thrones season 2, but she “struggled.” She revealed, “Season 2 would be my worst. I didn’t know what [my character] Daenerys was doing. If I am truly being honest, every minute of every day I thought I was going to die.”</p><p>Two years later, the actress went in for a routine brain scan in New York City and the doctors told her they had to “take care” of a second brain aneurysm using the same procedure as the first. Unfortunately, the surgery was not successful and medics had to do another procedure directly through her skull.</p><p>“The recovery was even more painful than it had been after the first surgery,” Clarke said. “I looked as though I had been through a war more gruesome than any that Daenerys experienced.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Solo: A Star Wars Story star remained hospitalized for a month and suffered “terrible … panic attacks” as a result of her condition. She emotionally explained, “[I was] convinced that I wasn’t going to live.”</p><p>Now, Clarke says she has “healed beyond [her] most unreasonable hopes” and is helping others who have suffered brain injuries recover through a charity called SameYou. She gushed, “I’m so happy to be here to see the end of this story and the beginning of whatever comes next.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaepZmhtqJ5wqWYq6OVYq%2BzscCkqmarmaGyr6%2FEZqanZaOqs6ex0aKloGViYq%2BzrcinZJqmlaq%2Fur%2FMrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
