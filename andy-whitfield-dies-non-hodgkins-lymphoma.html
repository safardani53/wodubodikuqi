When he was first diagnosed with stage 1 non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma in March 2010, Starz decided to produce a six-episode prequel series, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, allowing Andy time off to recover. He was declared cancer-free just two months later, and even boasted about his good health at Comic-Con last summer:</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I feel better than ever,” he said in July 2010 during the Spartacus panel at San Diego Comic-Con. “Like, seriously, I feel like I’m 10 years younger. I had a good rest.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>But in Sept. 2010, Starz announced Andy wouldn’t be returning to Spartacus after all, as his cancer returned and he needed to seek “aggressive treatment.” He was replaced by Australian actor <strong>Liam McIntyre</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Starz President and CEO <strong>Chris Albrecht</strong> had this to say in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline.com</a>:</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and colleague. [The] man who played a champion on-screen was also a champion in his own life. Andy was an inspiration to all of us as he faced this very personal battle with courage, strength and grace. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Get Glamorous With Our Friends At Glamour.com</strong></p><li><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Only 10 Styles You Need to Buy This Fall.
