He&nbsp;was given the death penalty in May 2017. But, his&nbsp;execution date has always been on debates concerning his&nbsp;<span>mental <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">illness</a>.&nbsp;</span>H<span>e claims to have PTSD, schizophrenia,&nbsp;and bipolar disorder. However, some psychiatrists insist that he is faking his mental illness to dodge the punishment.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span><strong>Nikko Jenkins in a courtroom during his hearing.</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Source: </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Omaha</span></a><span>)</span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite all the claimed mental health issues, Jenkins impressed Dawn Arguello. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a>&nbsp;her when she visited the prison as a volunteer for a nonprofit inmate advocacy group. Eventually, Arguello started vising him&nbsp;during his weekly visitations hours, and soon,&nbsp;the two began having feelings for each other. So much so, Jenkins even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tattooed</a>&nbsp;his girlfriend's name ‘Dawn’ across his face. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jenkins' Girlfriend&nbsp;Has A Different Opinion About Him, Says "He’s An Enigma"</h2><p>Most people despise Jenkins for his heinous crimes;&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>he killed four people while robbing them.</a>&nbsp;However, his criminal profile doesn't&nbsp;seem to matter to his Texas-resident girlfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, after Jenkins' love story with Arguello spread throughout the city, his girlfriend got quite the limelight. Almost every news outlet in Nebraska and other places began&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">calling</a>&nbsp;her&nbsp;to get details of their relationship.&nbsp;During those interviews, Arguello shared her differing opinion about the Omaha serial killer.</p><p>For instance, when a reporter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">asked</a>&nbsp;if she was already engaged to Nikko,&nbsp;Arguello&nbsp;neither declined nor confirmed the question. But, what she did was she vouched for her love interest. She called Nikko an ‘enigma’ and praised him for his wit and humor. Also, she mentioned that he was "wrongly treated in prison." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>A picture of Nikko Jenkins' girlfriend, Dawn Arguello </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mirror</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>Moreover, in a conversation with The Omaha World-Herald o</span>n December 14, 2019, Arguello&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>&nbsp;that Jenkins wasn’t what the media portrayed about him. She said he was sensitive, intelligent, and also manipulative like any other person having feelings. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He’s not what the media has made him out to be. He’s an enigma. He has feelings. He’s very sensitive. He’s very intelligent and, yes, he’s very manipulating.</p><h2>Dawn Arguello May Have Plans To Marry Nikko Jenkins</h2><p>As if the whole love story between the infamous Omaha serial killer, Nikko Jenkins, and Dawn Arguello wasn't peculiar enough, it has come to notice that Dawn has a desire to marry the death row inmate.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Omaha </a>World-Herald,&nbsp;Arguello refrained&nbsp;from commenting on the&nbsp;marriage topic. She told,</p><p>I’m not commenting on that(marriage). He’s never going to say anything; I’m never going to say anything.</p><p>Despite her reluctance to share about her marriage plans, the source revealed that Arguello reportedly has&nbsp;plans to share the wedding vows with Nikko.
