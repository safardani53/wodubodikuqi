Rumors have been swirling about the couple's relationship for some time now. Photos obtained exclusively by The U.S. Sun showed Kyle, 54, picking up food from a Studio City, California.
She was wearing workout clothes, suggesting that she either had been at the gym or intended to go.
Her thin frame was on full display in the photos, but it wasn't that which fans were focused on."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

News host Justin Sylvester sitting together looking lovingly at one another.</p><p>The reality TV star captioned the post: "For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.... #BFFS."</p><p>Fans took the post literally and were convinced the pair were a couple.</p><p>She took to her Instagram Story in 2022, writing: "Gotta love the internet, attaching an Instagram Story from an article that read in part: "Fans wonder if Kyle Richards has a new husband after star shares sweet pic with BFF Justin Sylvester."</p><p>The drama came shortly after Mauricio opened up about his marriage to Kyle on the Side Piece With Melissa Pfeister podcast, saying: "[I] let her talk, let her vent, let her talk about it, listen.</p><p>"You know, that's one of the most important things is to actually listen. I think her biggest frustration is when I am tuned out, and she wants to talk about it, and I have my mind on business and other stuff...That's hard."</p><p>He went on to suggest that things like that often lead to divorce, adding: "They get to see themselves on television, and they get to see the relationship of what it is themselves, and a lot of people have a perception of their own relationship being different than what it is, and then they see it because they watch it and then that causes the divorce."</p><h2>RHO-BACKSTAB</h2><p>There have been several rumors about divorce and infidelity but perhaps one of the most shocking suggested that Kyle's husband had cheated on her with her co-star Dorit Kemsley.</p><p>Dorit <a href=#>responded to the rumors</a> in 2022 after ex RHOBH star Dana Wilkey shared a fan mock-up that showed Mauricio and Dorit cuddled close.</p><p>In the image, Mauricio leaned his head against Dorit's as they appeared to be in each other's arms.</p><p>The caption stated: "An Affair To Remember."</p><p>Dana wrote: "The fans can’t stop talking about this! Thoughts?"</p><p>Dorit responded to the cheating allegations in the comments section.</p><p>She also accused Dana of being "one of the thirstiest people I've ever seen."</p><p>The reality star ranted: "Is something wrong with you woman?&nbsp;</p><p>"Or are you just so miserable in your life that you have nothing better to do?"</p><p>Dorit denied the cheating rumors and defended herself: "Kyle and Mau are our friends and my kids call them uncle and auntie.&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you think this is okay for my kids to see when it's a disgusting lie?"</p><p>She continued: "If this is the only way you can make a buck, then so be it.&nbsp;</p><p>"But at least have some decency and stop trying to peddle false narratives, especially when you know there is zero truth behind it and your whole motive is to just hurt people for no read."</p><p>Dorit concluded: "It's sad, pathetic, and bound to bite you in the a$$ inevitably."</p><p>Dana responded to Dorit's rant in an Instagram Story and wrote: "People don't read posts apparently."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She closed with: "However, that obviously struck a nerve," along with a laughing emoji.</p><p>Dorit is married to her husband,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Kemsley</a>, 54, and shares two children with him: Phoenix and Jagger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/controversial-housewife-tuesday-morning-showing-795975844.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/NINTCHDBPICT000796024242.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/real-trouble-rhobh-fans-suspect-796023952.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZGWFeYGWaKmhp5KdeqetzaxkrK2jpbKkwIyksKWdXae2pLTAq5usZaOluarAjKaYrqqZmLawedSmmKerm656pLjUnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
