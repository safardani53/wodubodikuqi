It does not come as a surprise as the Good Bones star has stretched her hands into various professions.</p><p>The reality star has appeared on six-season of Good Bones and taken up countless projects. It is reported that Mina earns approximately $65,000 annually for the show. At the same time, she is the co-founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Two Chicks & A Hammer</a>, a company she co-founded along with her mother.</p><p>The company was formed in 2017 when Mina purchased her first house. Mina and Karen decided to renovate the property together. While doing so, the pair realized how much they loved renovating. Due to this, they decided to give rise to their company and went on to appear on HGTV’s Good Bones.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mina Starsiak Hawk (@mina_starsiak_hawk)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=mina-starsiaks-personal-life-explored>Mina Starsiak’s personal life explored</h3><p>Mina is married to Steve Hawk. The pair got married in 2016 and have two beautiful children together. For Mina, the family has always been important. In fact, it was also the inspiration behind her book Built Together.</p><p>Speaking about her book, in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, Mina admitted she wanted to let people know about different types of families that exist. She said: “</p><p>I just thought it was a fun take on construction, like how you build a house, everyone does it different. You start with a good foundation and then you make it pink or yellow or blue or… And the same thing with the family. Mine was definitely all hodgepodge together.”</p><p>She continued: “My step-parents, ex-step-siblings, half-siblings, people that I call aunt and uncle that are just my parents’ good friends. People my kids call aunt and uncle that are just my good friends, but that I consider part of my family. So yeah, that’s the thought.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfnbS1wo6moKeZXajBor7SopikZZ6awW7DzquroQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
