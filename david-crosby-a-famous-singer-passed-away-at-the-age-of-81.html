Crosby is most known for being a founding member of the rock bands ‘Byrds’ and ‘Crosby, Stills, and Nash.’</p><p>Graham Nash, a musician, paid homage to him on Facebook, writing:</p><p>“In both life and music, David was brave. He leaves a huge vacuum in terms of pure personality and skill in our planet. Through his lovely music, he expressed his ideas, heart, and passion, and he leaves an unforgettable legacy. These are the most important considerations. My heart goes out to his wife, Jan, his son, Django, and everyone he has touched in this life.”</p><p>Randy Bachman, a guitarist and vocalist, also paid homage to Crosby on Facebook, writing:</p><p>“David Crosby, rest in peace. When BTO was a “bar band,” I sung so many of his tunes. I believed he was a terrific composer and was surprised at how he overcame adversity and continued to make music. Millions of people, including his loved ones, will miss him.”</p><p>David’s cause of death has not been disclosed, and there are currently no preparations for a memorial.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/David-Crosby-1.jpg alt="David Crosby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>David Crosby has struggled with health concerns in recent years.</h2><p>David had to get a liver transplant in 1994 because he had hepatitis C. He was eventually diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, which had a negative impact on his weight. Audiences noticed his weight loss, which was caused by the disease, during a performance in 2008. To keep his diabetes under control, he had to utilize insulin.&nbsp;In February 2014, Crosby had to have a heart catheterization and angiography. His left anterior coronary artery was revealed to be 90% obstructed, and blood supply to his heart muscles was restored using two stents. At the time, he stated:</p><p>“I’m pleased I listened to my physicians and my family. It seems that I am once again an extremely fortunate guy. I’m sorry we had to change the dates, but I guarantee the music will be great when we do.”</p><p>The physicians advised David to rest before returning to the stage for his performances. He finally had to cancel his gigs at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco and the Troubadour in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2>David Crosby’s career</h2><p>David Crosby joined The Byrds in 1964 and worked on five albums with them. In 1968, he formed the folk-rock band Crosby, Stills, and Nash.&nbsp;Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, and Neil Young were also members of CSN. Their self-titled first album was published in 1969 and peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 in the United States. They went on to create seven more albums and win notoriety for their hits till 1999.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/David-Crosby.jpg alt="David Crosby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>David launched a solo career in 1971 with the publication of his debut album If I Could Only Remember My Name.
