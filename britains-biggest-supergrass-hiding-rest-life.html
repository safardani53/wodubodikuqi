into the UK by a Mr Big was seized.</p><p>It led to the informant, named only as Mr X, being held hostage by sadistic enforcers.</p><p>They tried to cut off his ear with a Stanley knife — in a gruesome copy of a scene from Quentin Tarantino’s blood-thirsty 1992 crime film Reservoir Dogs.</p><p>They also threatened to remove his testicles with pliers and smash his knee caps with a hammer.</p><p>He managed to escape but realised his only hope of survival was to work with the police.</p><p>He became a CHIS (covert human intelligence source) informing on the gangs to detectives but they quickly feared his cover would be blown so instead he was taken into a witness protection programme.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

interviews.</p><p>It produced 10,000 pages of vital information which led to six trials over five years.</p><p>Organised crime gangs with links to the Balkans, Spain, France and Brazil were dismantled thanks to Mr X.</p><p>The help he gave police was said to be “the greatest ever provided in this country”.</p><p>One detective said: “This has made a significant impact on international organised crime.”</p><p>Mr X is living under a new identity and is thought to be abroad but is unlikely to ever feel totally safe.</p><p>The court heard the gangs will hire professional hitmen to hunt him down and they are so ruthless that even his barrister cannot be named for fear of reprisals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000648779092.jpg><p>The judge told Mr X: “If your life wasn’t in danger before, I am absolutely certain that it is now.”</p><p>The full story of how he helped bring down a multi-million-pound international drugs operation can only now be revealed following the end of the final trial.</p><p>The dramatic events began unfolding in the summer of 2015 when David Gloyne, the head of a feared North East crime gang, plotted to ship 50kgs of cocaine into Britain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000648778943.jpg><p>With the help of former Yugoslavia-born Yvan Nikolic, he arranged for the shipment to arrive at Tilbury Docks in Essex after being transported from Brazil.</p><p>The consignment arrived safely but things began to go wrong when Gloyne sent some of his gang to collect it.</p><p>The men bought hi-viz jackets from B&Q to pose as workmen and use wire cutters to break into a secure compound.</p><p>But their jackets were the wrong colour and suspicious security guards quickly spotted them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000648779070.jpg><p>They fled without recovering the drugs, which were seized by police.</p><p>The botched operation was a disaster for Gloyne’s gang, which had banked on making tens of millions from selling the drugs across the North East of England.</p><p>They were now strapped for cash, which triggered a series of fall-outs across the network of organised crime gangs in the region.</p><p>The simmering tensions erupted in horrific violence when the gangs turned on each other.</p><p>Mr X had been involved in the botched recovery of the drugs at Tilbury and also had spiralling debts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000648779089.jpg><p>At one stage, he became embroiled in a plot to steal 27kg of cocaine belonging to Gloyne in a desperate attempt to pay off debts.</p><p>Gloyne’s heavies kidnapped and tortured him but he managed to escape.</p><p>Fearing his life was now at risk, he decided his only option to keep himself and his family safe was to work with police.</p><p>In November 2015, he became a CHIS and two months later Operation Everest was launched by the North East Regional Special Operations Unit to target the organised crime gangs.</p><p>Officers quickly became worried Mr X’s cover might be blown so they stopped using him as a CHIS and instead took him into witness protection.</p><p>Detectives then began the long process of debriefing him and over the next eight months he was able to pass on a vast amount of knowledge of the inner workings of the gangs.</p><p>As part of the deal, he had to confess to all of his own crimes which amounted to 23 offences including drug-dealing, arson and burglary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/c57b4baf-d052-469e-a0bc-c20ad96add89.jpg><p>Prosecutor Richard Herrmann told Teesside crown court: “He saw it as his only way out from his life of crime which had spiralled dangerously out of control, bringing onto him and his family threat to life.</p><p>“Being in debt in the underworld of large-scale drug dealing is not a good place to be.”</p><p>He was facing 14 years in jail but, because of the help he gave police, that was reduced to 15 months suspended for two years.</p><p>Mr Hermann said: “The breadth and depth of the assistance provided is on a wholly unprecedented and exceptional scale, beyond anything previously undertaken in this jurisdiction.”</p><p>Thanks to his information, cops made dozens of arrests across Europe.</p><p>One major player was arrested in Greece and another was held in Marbella.</p><p>Mr X gave evidence in six trials between January 2018 and March 2021.</p><img

criminals.</p><p>His lawyer told the court: “Never before or after has there been such a prolific success story for the undermining of organised crime.</p><p>“The reality is he is in danger and will forever be in danger.</p><p>"One of the consequences of his decision to assist the Crown in this way is for the rest of his life he will have a target on his back.”</p><p>Judge Deborah Sherwin told him: “I doubt there has ever been a case where an assisting offender has given so much evidence against so many offenders.</p><p>“It is believed the assistance you have provided is the greatest ever provided in this country.</p><p>“If your life wasn’t in danger before, I am absolutely certain that it is now.</p><p>"Wherever you live, you will spend your life constantly having to look over your shoulder and in fear.</p><p>“I have no doubt you will be actively and professionally sought by those who wish you harm. You will be forced to be vigilant for the rest of your life.”</p><p>Detective Inspector Alan Turner commented: “He made it abundantly clear he was in fear for his life well before the agreement.</p><p>"He was at risk of serious violence and people had committed serious assaults on him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>“In this case, his and his family’s safety was the big motive.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“He knew an awful lot because he was deeply embedded in the drug trade at such a significant level. He was dealing in 80-90 kilos of cocaine. That is worth more than £4million.”</p><p>The detective added: “There is ongoing intelligence on threats to him every day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000004968191.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Crimewatch ask for information on the whereabouts of a violent prisoner, Michael Benson in archive clip</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoF4gJZpaG1nkqe2ta3Ip6pmmpmctKa%2F02aqrqiVp7SzrdKsZKGhlJ67qHnRnqqtZZyes6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
