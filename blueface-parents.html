If it’s not the 2022 attempted murder he was arrested for, then it’s the naked photos of his baby he shared to ask for advice. Naturally, Blueface’s mother, <a href=#>Karlissa Saffold</a>, had something to say as she lifts up her family’s image in their new Patreon reality series, CixoT: The Real LA Family Blues.</p><p>Blueface first gained notoriety with his 2018 song, “Respect My Crippin’,” followed by his even more popular “Thotiana,” in which he references his ex-football career. Born Johnathan Jamall Porter on Jan. 20, 1997, Blueface now has 2.5 million Instagram followers, which shows how popular he’s grown over the past few years.

He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Jumper</a> that he moved around a lot between his parents, who separated in 2000 and dealt with various custody battles after that. He went to several elementary schools before he moved in with his mom in Santa Clarity Valley.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When his dad, Johnathan Michael Porter Sr., moved to Oakland, Blueface stayed with him instead. Reports suggest that although Johnathan stays out of the limelight, he and his son are still close. Johnathan was reportedly a coach and although he once lived in Oakland, it’s unclear where he lives now.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Karlissa, on the other hand, has followed in her son’s footsteps towards fame. She was a homemaker throughout his childhood, but she remarried to Sterling Saffold in April 2018. Sterling played football for the San Diego Chargers and is currently a motivational speaker and mentor for young athletes.</p><p>While Karlissa produces her family’s reality series, she also founded Angelic Fitness in 2020 and she works as a fitness and transformational coach to women who want to lose weight. Now, Karlissa lives in Columbus, Ohio with Sterling after a 2021 argument with Blueface and his then-girlfriend.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rap-Up</a>, Blueface kicked his mom and younger sister, Kali, out of his home. Surveillance video shows Karlissa showing up with Kali unannounced because she was tired of Kali “freeloading” off of her. However, Blueface wasn’t supportive of this and kicked them both out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“[Since] they wanna go viral so bad, this the real story: My mom got tired of my broke ass sister free-loading at her house so she brought her to mine, [and] I wasn’t going for it,” he said. “I already got her an apartment guess that wasn’t enough she want my car she want me to buy her a car off the lot an some more stuff. [sic]”</p><p>Blueface revealed that he was homeless for years when he got into gang life, which he promised his mom he would never do. However, when she wouldn’t take him in out of his car, he “had to thug it out.” In doing so, he made a name for himself rapping, and is now a multi-millionaire.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Blueface is also a parent to three children.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Blueface was more recently dating <a href=#>Chrisean Rock</a>, with whom he had a son earlier in 2023. But before he dated her, he had two children with <a href=#>Jaidyn Alexis,</a> and it now seems that they're together again. Throughout the years, Karlissa has often clashed with Blueface’s partners. The latest drama regarding the nude picture of Blueface’s infant son is just the latest in a string of arguments between Chrisean and Karlissa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7m2scWamp5loJa%2FprrTrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
