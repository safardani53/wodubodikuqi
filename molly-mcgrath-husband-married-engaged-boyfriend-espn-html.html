She mentioned that she was extremely proud to be a full-time working pregnant woman and how her condition would never slow her down - women are an incredible lot. She finished off by saying that anyone who didn’t see that could, in her own words, kiss her big achey butt.</p><p>I am proud to be a pregnant woman working full-time and I am proud that the magnitude of creating a human life has not, and will not, slow me down.
