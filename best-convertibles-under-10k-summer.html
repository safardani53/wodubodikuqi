Just slide in behind the wheel, drop the top and away you go - it’s a great way to travel.
Of course, there are a lot of expensive new models to choose from, but wind-in-your-hair motoring doesn’t need to break the bank - and you’ll be surprised at what you can get if you’re prepared to explore the used market and dig out a bargain."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Around £10k will buy you a 2001 model with just 36k miles on the clock, while its 2.7-litre flat six engine sounds so good with the roof down</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="RED MORE ABOUT CONVERTIBLES HERE">RED MORE ABOUT CONVERTIBLES HERE</h2><p><strong>Mazda MX-5 Mk2, 2002, 5k, £9,995</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/B5PREMjpg-JS804447023.jpg><p>If you don’t fancy a Boxster, then there’s always the classic Mazda MX-5 to consider. The Mk2 isn’t as good-looking as the first generation model with the pop-up headlights, but the later car still handles well enough. Pistonheads found a model with incredibly low mileage - just 5,000 miles covered from new. A classy machine for not too much money.</p><p><strong>Lotus Elan M100, 1991, 140k, £8,495</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/JTDY84jpg-JS804447018.jpg><p>OK, a Lotus with over 100k miles may not be everyone’s idea of a reliable summer convertible, but a well-cared for example is still worth a look. The other thing to point out is that Lotus is said to have spent an unprecedented £37m developing it and it shows in the way it drives.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p><strong>Alfa Romeo Spider V6, 2007, 77k, £9,995</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/B4D02Njpg-JS804447021.jpg><p>Alfas have a reputation for offering stunning design, but less impressive reliability. The Spider looks absolutely fantastic, which is the key to what many convertible buyers are looking for - and it also comes with a 260hp V6 engine.</p><p><strong>Mercedes-Benz SL500, 2005, 76k, £9,995</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BXPWNTjpg-JS804446929.jpg><p>The Mercedes is without doubt one of the classiest contenders on the list. However, you do need to stick to the basics with a car as complex as this - making sure it comes with service history and perhaps paying out for an independent inspection before you commit to buying. A 2005 model obviously won’t be perfect underneath due to its age and mileage, but at least you’ll know if any big bills are coming up.</p><p><strong>Nissan 350 Z Roadster, 2009, 81k, £9,995</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2EA069Pjpg-JS804446930.jpg><p>The 350 Z Roadster is a truly fine car that is worthy of inclusion here. It’s an easy daily driver, with a pretty smooth ride, but is capable of offering decent levels of fun, too, with its 3.5-litre V6 engine powerful enough to put a smile on your face. With the roof down you’ll be able to enjoy things even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzfZZwbG5rYmSvpr%2FTZpqopqaav7W1waWcrGWlo7GmvoxqZ6Rlo6q6rrHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
