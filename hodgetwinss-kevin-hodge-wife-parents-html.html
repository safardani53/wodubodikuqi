His wife's name is Elizabeth Hodge.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Keith is also blessed with kids from his marriage. While having an exclusive talk for 2013’s summer edition of Urban Lux Magazine,&nbsp;published on July 1, 2013, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that he and his wife were parents of three children.</p><p>At that time, his children were aged 12, 6, and 3, which means they are aged 20, 14, and 11, as of 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the same interview, Kevin also disclosed that he and his wife had four children at that time, who were aged 17-year-old, 10-year-old, 5-year-old, and 10-month-old.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Going by that, Kevin's kids are 25, 18, 13, and 9-year-old, presently.</p><h2>Secret to Kevin's Long Marriage Is Good Communication</h2><p>When Kevin was asked what is his secret to his long marriage during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with LA Weekly magazine in June 2016, he replied that it was "just communication." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He explained that there would be lots of&nbsp;ups and downs in a married relationship, and it requires sitting down and talking about it sensibly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"...you have a lot of ups and downs. It's just a matter of sitting down and, y'know, getting through things," Kevin said.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He further added, "I would say communication and compromise."</p><h2>Details on Kevin’s Parents & Family Members</h2><p>Hailing from Martinsville, Virginia, Kevin was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a> on September 17, 1975, as Kevin N.

Together, they are known as The Hodgertwins.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The twin brothers initiated their career as YouTubers when Keith <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">proposed</a> the idea to Kevin after being fed up with the different full-time/part-time jobs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kevin liked his twin brother’s idea and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">created</a> their channel, TheHodgeTwins, on December 22, 2008.</p><p>Initially, they began uploading comedy videos, and when their channel started to grow, they made videos on present conditions while also giving&nbsp;their opinions. Slowly and gradually, they added more content topics to their videos—relationship advice and fitness videos.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As of now, the twin brothers are no more strangers in the field of content creation with four <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube channels</a>&nbsp;to their names—Conservative Twins, askhodgetwins, TwinMuscle, and Hodgetwins Vlogs.

For instance,&nbsp;Michael Dove of Arkansas, James MacKenzie of Scotland, and Alicia Mumm of Jacksonville told the Martinsville Bulletin via chat messages&nbsp;that they followed the Hodgetwins and simply responded the request for support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528pbPEra6ipqOoeqyx1aKlZqCfmbSmedainZ5loJa%2FprrTrGWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
