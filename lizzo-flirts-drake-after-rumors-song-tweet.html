Drake has yet to reply to the bold move, but the fans would be&nbsp;more&nbsp;than here for this potential superstar romance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Ahead of dropping the sexy tune, produced by “Truth Hurts” collaborator <strong>Ricky Reed</strong>, the Detroit native teased the Drake mention. “I just thought [the line] would be so funny to say…I just feel like women, there’s so many times where girls’ names get dropped in songs because they’re fine,” she confessed to on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Apple Music 1’s New Music Daily to host <strong>Zane Lowe</strong></a> on Aug. 12. The GRAMMY winner went on to reveal she&nbsp;does&nbsp;actually know the “Hotline Bling” rapper. “I have a small relationship with him. He’s very cool,” she added.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As fans know, Lizzo has a history of being bold with her potential romantic pursuits! The singer didn’t hold back, for example, when she saw <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Niall Horan</strong></a>, 27, at a London studio. “We’re passing in the corridor, I was like, ‘Ah! Lovely to meet you!’ Gave her a big hug,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Niall recounted to <strong>Jimmy Fallon </strong></a>back in 2019. After the former One Directioner complimented her “incredible” voice and said she was “smashing it,” Lizzo apparently retorted, “You can smash this!” The moment left Niall blushing. “I was just like, fair play…I actually started blushing myself!” he confessed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lizzo-flirt-drake-rumors-shutterstock-post-.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Just recently, Lizzo also put her feelers out <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>with longtime crush Chris Evans</a> — hilariously pretending to be pregnant with his child. She went as far to DM him, prompting the actor to reply. “Listen, that Taurus, Gemini energy, honey, unmatched. It’s unmatched. He said that…. We have plans — well, we don’t have plans — but he did say he will come to a show and I was like, ‘okay, shots on me’,” she said to <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> on Aug. 13.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lizzo-flirt-drake-rumors-shutterstock-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Shots aside, Lizzo had her own ideas of how the evening would play out. “So here’s my scenario. He’s naked in the green room. And he has body shots all on his chest. And I walk in and I slowly just suck them off…,” she trailed off, before bursting out in laughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5BuZqWhqq%2B8brLLoqmtq12Zv6K3xGaYn6yVp3qzwcyoqaxlo6S7qHnTsJyerF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
