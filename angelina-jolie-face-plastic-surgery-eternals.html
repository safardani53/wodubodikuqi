I wonder how quickly Primark can get them on the shelves,” one person tweeted.</p><p>The actress - the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Michaelle Bertrand - is known for her edgy style and regularly changing up her look.</p><p>But her <a href=#>ever-youthful appearing skin</a> and stunning looks have raised eyebrows among fans over the years.</p><p>Some have questioned whether she's undergone cosmetic surgery - a claim Ange denied before her 2013 double mastectomy and breast reconstruction.</p><p>“I haven’t had anything done and I don’t think I will… I don’t plan to do it myself,” she told the Daily Mail in 2010.</p><p>But experts have since cast doubt on her claim.</p><p>Alice Henshaw, owner of <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Harley Street Injectables</a>, tells The Sun there’s "no way" she'd have been able to maintain her wrinkle-free complexion without preventative treatment.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>“We believe her lips are natural but I would definitely say she’s had Botox, skin tightening treatment and maybe fillers," Alice says.</p><p>“Angelina has definitely had injectibles, but in a way that’s very subtle and immaculately placed, like J.Lo.”</p><p>Here we look back at “The Changeling” appearance of Angelina Jolie over the years.&nbsp;</p><h2>Child star</h2><p>Angelina was five years old when she filmed a brief one-day role in the 1982 flick Lookin’ To Get Out.</p><p>She played sweet Tosh Warner who charmingly quizzed Alex Kovac - played by her father Jon - about his injuries.</p><p>It was her first film role and, if you didn't know it was her, you'd easily fail to recognise the young star in her old-fashioned dress and hat.</p><h2>Told she was 'too dark’ to make it</h2><p>It took a while for Angelina to nab her next film role - despite having a famous father and connections to Hollywood.</p><p>In her teen years she modelled and starred in a number of music videos including Meat Loaf’s 1993 cover of Rock & Roll Dreams Come Through.</p><p>“He was a genie with pointy ears and I was a runaway,” she recalled during a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone.</p><p>Angelina also appeared in a music video with Lenny Kravitz and several short films.</p><p>Back then she had long hair and no tattoos and claimed she'd been told she was “too dark” in auditions and would not make it as an actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000687758886.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/317a21be-0a5e-4a18-a71f-f82bec6a010e.jpg><h2>Pixie-cut</h2><p>In her first film as an adult, Angelina sported short-cropped hair and heavily plucked eyebrows that had been shaped into a high arch.&nbsp;</p><p>She was 20 years old when she starred in the 1995 flick Hackers - about a team of IT whizzes who set out to stop a deadly computer virus from being released.</p><p>Angelina kept her pixie look for other films and styled it in different ways, including a comb-over, before growing her hair out again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1755ab0d-2330-4126-90d3-77c6a2f4962e.jpg><h2>Dreadlock to vampire look</h2><p>The actress' hair was mid-length during a critically acclaimed performance in The Bone Collector in 1999.</p><p>One year later she was compared to a "vampire" while sporting long jet black locks and pale make-up at the Academy Awards.</p><p>It followed an unusual fashion faux-pas during the 2000 film Gone In Sixty Seconds, when she wore blonde dreadlocks.&nbsp;</p><p>Ange continued to rock a paler complexion and long dark hair during her short-lived marriage to Billy Bob Thornton, which ended in 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/be60c03a-ac24-40ef-ab2e-bfda55e38d3e.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9c82ca34-4f6b-46ba-a190-6f82399c5563.jpg><h2>Boob job debate</h2><p>Since Angelina’s first Lara Croft film in 2001, rumours began to circulate about the size of her chest.&nbsp;</p><p>It was claimed she'd had a boob job to play the busty video game action hero, who famously had DD-cups.</p><p>Angelina quashed rumours about her going under the knife and revealed she used “a bit of padding” instead.</p><p>“C’mon, I’m not so flat-chested to begin with. When I wear a tight T-shirt, I look a certain way,” she told <a href=#>NY Rock magazine</a> in 2001.</p><p>Angelina said the production team reduced Lara Croft’s bust by one cup size, which made it easier to give the impression her C-cups were D-cups.</p><p>However, not everyone agrees purely padding was involved - including Alice.</p><p>“I mean come on we’ve all seen Tomb Raider, it definitely looks like she’s had breast augmentation," she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000528122254.jpg><h2>Pale to bronze</h2><p>By 2003, Angelina’s appearance had changed drastically again as she switched up her pale make-up for a more bronzed look.</p><p>It was then when she started to use some of her signature make-up tricks including nude lips, no blush and winged eyeliner.</p><p>Two years later in 2005, she was dating Brad Pitt after they met filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
