Despite all of the technological advancements that our phones have made over the past 20 years or so, the one thing that remains consistent is how annoying it can be to visit your local mobile provider.

Unfortunately, this mom had to contend with just that scenario after a <a href=#>T-Mobile</a> phone store manager erased all of her phone's data. Let's break down what happened.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A phone store manager erases a customer's phone data with zero chance of recovery.</h2><p>Though the TikTok started making the rounds again in early September 2023, the event itself actually took place earlier in January. It was originally posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@maisolmandonad46</a>, but was later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> by Briana Germain (@bgermain007), the daughter of the woman who lost her phone data.</p><p>As for the video itself, it captures the entire bizarre exchange between the woman, identified as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loni Delmonico</a>, and the T-Mobile store manager at the time.</p><p>At the time of recording, Loni was already complaining that the data on her phone was completely erased.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Loni claims that she came into the store for help connecting her new <a href=#>smartwatch</a> to her phone. She then had to hand in her device to the manager. When she got it back, it had apparently gone through a factory reset with all of its data wiped.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For the manager's part, he couldn't even explain what had happened that led to her phone's data being erased. In fact, he seemed to have a lot of trouble forming complete sentences in order to address Loni's complaints.</p><p>It took her several minutes of talking in circles with the manager before they told her they could leave her contact information for a higher-up to get back to her.</p><p>But as if to add insult to injury, the manager told Loni that she was the one who "messed up" her own phone.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Shockingly enough, the story gets wilder from there. Folks on <a href=#>Reddit</a> were able to glean some more information surrounding the incident. Reportedly, the manager didn't just erase her phone data. He also "nuked" her iCloud so that any backups she might have had were also gone. Some reports even claim that the manager was drunk at the time and had the cops called on him during the same day.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>To make matters worse, Loni lost some truly precious things when her data was erased. Chief among them were voicemails of her dearly departed mother, which are nothing short of irreplaceable.</p><p>In a Facebook comment posted at the time, Loni even claimed that T-Mobile asked for a statement from her once the company caught wind of the incident.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although some folks were quick to accuse Loni of being a Karen, many actually sided with her as they empathized with the fact that her data was erased due to sheer negligence.</p><p>On Reddit, one person wrote, "That lady is being incredibly calm and reasonable. I could not have been."</p><p>Another Redditor echoed the sentiment, replying, "The fact that she is so calm and not going full Karen makes the story that much more believable. She just wants a resolution."</p><p>Hopefully, your next visit to a mobile service provider won't be nearly as disastrous as this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbWwusRmqq2nopp6rq3Nmp6eql2av6K%2FxKxkqaCfo7JusMCtmA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
