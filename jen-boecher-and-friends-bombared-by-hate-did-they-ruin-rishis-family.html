Rishi has personally defended Jen in the wake of the episode. He even said that Jen’s friends did him a “favor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Rishi ended the episode in tears.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of viewers had a lot to say on social media. About Jen. About her friends.</p><p><a href=#>Rishi has personally defended Jen</a> in the wake of the episode. He even said that Jen’s friends did him a “favor.”</p><p>But 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way fans say that Jen and her friends have crossed way too many lines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jen Boecher’s friends are there for her — they provide her with emotional support. They even traveled halfway around the world to cheer her on in India.</p><p>But Randi and Myra (and particularly Randi) have also gotten onto the bad side of some viewers. Though Randi catfished Rishi as a favor to Jen, some fans did not understand the move. And they labeled it “intrusive.”</p><p>That sentiment only increased after Season 4, Episode 13. This was when, with the help of a translator and with Jen’s blessing, Randi revealed the three-year engagement to Rishi’s mom and uncle. This screenshot speaks for itself:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rishi had hidden this relationship, not to mention the engagement, for three years.</p><p>His mother and uncle expressed astonishment. They clearly had not seen this coming.</p><p>Privately, however, they condemned the romance — telling the cameras (and, later, Rishi) that this could never happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A large (frankly, astonishing) number of replies on social media were nothing short of scathing when it comes to Jen and her friends.</p><p>People accused her of “bullying” Rishi, of “disrespecting” him, his family, and “Indian culture” at every step of the way.</p><p>A lot of uncharitable responses to Jen and Rishi’s drama essentially labeled Jen a villain who was “ruining” a family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And a large number of longtime fans of the series drew comparisons to Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh, another American woman dating a younger Indian man. Another couple where their primary issue was the man’s family.</p><p>Obviously, with rare exceptions, tweeting or otherwise posting your take on pop culture is just part of being a fan. Sometimes it’s a little mean, but one hopes that the cast doesn’t see it.</p><p>However, people were directly sending messages to Jen, including her DMs, excoriating her after the episode aired. It became too much.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So, on Sunday night, Rishi took to Instagram to defend Jen. (And, in the process, to confirm what we already knew — that Jen and Rishi <a href=#>are still together</a>)</p><p>“Dear fans, I do not like to see Jen upset,” he began his caption.</p><p>“And she is VERY UPSET by the DMs & condemnations,” Rishi told his followers, “about some things that i should have cleared up a long time ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“1. Jen has been coming to India since 2014,” Rishi began his list, “and is very familiar with the general Indian culture.”</p><p>He then revealed: “2. When I proposed, I told her that my family was 100% fine with me choosing my own bride AND we could live in our own place ( joint family not necessary).”</p><p>Rishi also listed: “3. Regardless of when my family found out about the engagement, there would have had issues with the age difference. Her friends did me a favor.” Score one for Randi.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rishi made a request: “4. Please stop suggesting to Jen that. A. she is ‘trying to change me/the culture’ (see #1+2) OR B. She ‘should have learned from Jenny & Sumit.'”</p><p>He very fairly asked: “5. Why are people lumping ALL Indians and ALL Americans into the same categories?” A solid point.</p><p>“Not ALL Indian people are the same just as not ALL American people are the same,” Rishi then stressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“To assume that Sumit represents all Indian men or that Jenny represents all &nbsp;American women is ridiculous and small-minded,” Rishi very accurately informed his followers.</p><p>“They are absolutely wonderful people,” he acknowledged, “but THEY ARE NOT US.”</p><p>Rishi concluded his post by addressing more enthusiastic fans, writing: “Thank you for your support!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jen and Rishi signed up for reality television. But that does not mean that they signed up for harassment. Judgment? Sure. Not directed cruelty in their inboxes. In Jen’s, mostly.</p><p>Rishi surely knows better than viewers what Jen is like, what her intentions are, and whether her actions were disrespectful. Right?</p><p>Don’t get us wrong — the idea of “ambushing” someone with relationship news is not something that most people would do. But it sounds like, to Rishi, it was helpful in the long run.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WCcLbEp2Sbp5WYtaa%2BjJqlnWWWp7amusOsZJunnZeus7HDZpmyZZiWwaZ5w6KbZqyYmsZuvtSipWaqmai1qr%2BMn5imoZyufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
