"I mean, if I got to a place where I was incapacitated or something but up until then I think I'm… I mean, look at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Johnny Cash</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Pete Seeger</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Cash and Seeger performed well into their golden years, and Springsteen even recalled sharing the stage with an 89-year-old Seeger at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barack Obama</a>'s inauguration in 2009.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I look at those guys and go, 'Yeah, I don't know if I'll [always] be doing three-hour shows, but I have so many different kinds of music that I can play and do,'" he explained. "The Broadway show I can do for the rest of my life in one form or another if I wanted to.

"It felt good. It was good. She's super talented. [I know her] just a little bit. She's a tremendous writer and I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>know her producer Jack Antonoff</a> very well. Just making great records."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Springsteen will release his new album Only the Strong Survive, a collection of soul hits, on Nov. 11. He told Stern that while he chose 15 songs to include, another 40 were left on the cutting room floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I worked very hard on my singing on this record," he said. "I basically chose songs that I love and … [that] got my voice out front."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Come February, Springsteen and the E Street Band will <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>kick off a 31-date North American tour</a> that will end in April in the rocker's native New Jersey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After that, Springsteen and company will head to Europe, for which they announced tour dates in May.
