These garments were later worn as military outfits, utilizing waterproof material for protection from rain and repurposed as a sheet for sleeping. When cloaks and capes started exiting the fashion world, ponchos took their place with a retro twist. Modern ponchos are all about comfort and functionality but certainly not at the cost of style. They come in a variety of designs to suit your body type, occasion, and personal fashion style. If you’re not into chunky knits and oversized coats, there are perfect options for you too. Here is everything you need to know before embracing the modern poncho for a fail-proof fashion-forward look.</span></p><h3>Poncho vs Shawl</h3><p><span>Let’s first clear up one thing. Although they all belong to a similar style family, ponchos, <a href=#>shawls</a>, and wraps are not the same thing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A poncho is a large, usually square, piece of material with a hole in the middle to fit your head through. It technically doesn’t have sleeves, although it covers your arms and drapes over your shoulders, back, and front. Ponchos are sometimes referred to as chamantos in central Chile or ruanas in some areas of Columbia and Venezuela.</span></p><p><span>The shawl, on the other hand, is usually worn around one's shoulders and generally has a rectangular shape, although this can vary according to manufacturers and designs. It’s not big enough to wrap around your body more than once and has a fairly unstructured fit.</span></p><p><span>A wrap is larger in size than a shawl. It is a long piece of fabric with flowing qualities that can be draped and styled around your body with ease and in any way you like. They can be turned into skirts, dresses, tops, or scarves when folded, wrapped, and tied correctly.</span></p><h3>How to Choose the Best Poncho for Style and Shape</h3><h4><span>Check the neckline</span></h4><p><span>Ponchos are available in a variety of neckline designs, including scoop-neck, V-neck, cowl-neck, boat neck, and turtle-neck options. Just like choosing a complimentary neckline for your body and face applies to any piece of clothing you wear, it applies to choosing a poncho as well. The right neckline will help structure the frame of your face perfectly, allowing your neck and face to look slim and compliment your natural features and body shape.</span></p><h4><span>Define your outfit style</span></h4><p><span>There are numerous poncho styles out there and they aren’t all suitable for every occasion. Some designs are geared to formal and professional occasions, while others have a much more casual look to them. What you pair your poncho with can also make a big difference. Decide what level of formality you need your outfit to have and ensure your ponchos style matches that.</span></p><h4><span>Choose according to your body shape</span></h4><p><span>There is a misconception that ponchos are only for plus-size women and that you don’t need to take body shape into consideration like you would with other clothes. However, these items can look great on all sizes, and knowing which fit and features are best for your body type will help you pull it off with a lot of pizzazz. Opt for a poncho that ends an inch above the knees if you want something long to wear with a pair of tights or skinny jeans. Plus-sized women should stick to solid colors, avoid highly tailored styles, and opt for a straighter cut.</span></p><h4><span>Hooded options</span></h4><p><span>Hooded options can be great for keeping warm and protecting you (and your hair) from the wind and rain. Make sure the style fits you and that the hood covers your whole head as opposed to slipping off continuously.</span></p><h4><span>How to pair your poncho</span></h4><p><span>Since ponchos already make quite a statement due to their size, you really don’t need to add too much more drama to your outfit. It is best to opt for slightly understated designs rather than wearing items that are full of prints or are shiny.</span></p><p><span>Certain patterns can make your waist look slimming, but keep them simple. When wearing a patterned poncho, make sure the rest of your outfit consists of solid colors. The best way to wear a poncho is with skinny jeans or leggings, seeing as baggy pants with a poncho usually come off sloppy looking.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwrc%2BpmKudnGS9sLrCoaZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
