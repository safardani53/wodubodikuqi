"Where he was saying that she was drinking alcohol and packing her things."</p><p>There was a dispute over the packing of bags and, eventually, Karine began speaking in Portuguese.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fans responding to the Instagram Live were, as always, begging Karine to leave Paul.</p><p>"She was crying and visibly shaking while talking to him while his head was poked through the door," John Yates describes.</p><p>"There was a loud sound and then the live ended," he notes. "Not before Paul reprimanded Karine for breaking NDA."</p><p>At some points during the video, Paul appeared to be speaking, in English, to someone outside of the room.</p><p>A small mercy is that their baby, Pierre, was nowhere in sight — though that just raised more questions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The good news is that some of the people who caught the Instagram Live spoke Portuguese.</p><p>As one fan notes, apparently Karine said that she returned from a sleepover at her parents’ home, only for Paul to allegedly go crazy.</p><p>It looks like they’re both accusing each other of having made a mess out of the packed up luggage.</p><p>Baby Pierre was said to be still at her parents’ house.</p><p>John Yates notes that he reached out to Paul, who said that "things weren’t good and that Karine is with her parents."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We have a strong suspicion that Paul and Karine may have been filming for 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>Yes, they are currently on 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way, though this latest episode may explain why they were packing to go to the US.</p><p>That would explain why Paul was speaking in English to people in the other room, and why he mentioned Instagram Live and the NDA.</p><p>It’s June — last year, during this month, original recipe 90 Day Fiance was filming.</p><p>Maybe Paul’s family finally decided to help him sponsor Karine to come to the US?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So, as you may recall, Paul’s original plan was to go to Brazil, be with his much younger bride, and bring her back to the US to live.</p><p>That didn’t work out, in part because Paul didn’t have the cash to cover the K-1 visa process for Karine.</p><p>Instead, the new plan was for him to remain in Brazil and just live with Karine and their baby, Pierre, together.</p><p>Except that, on the latest episode, we found that his bid for residency was denied — on the grounds of "terrorism."</p><p>Paul was very upset over the unexpected denial and the unexplained charge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We think that we can explain that.</p><p>See, <a href=#>Paul had a criminal history</a> long before he ever came to Brazil.</p><p>Specifically, he committed arson back in 2007. In fact, when last we checked, he’s still on "shock probation" and will be until April 2020.</p><p>Then, in 2013, Paul was arrested for violating a protective order — which is a huge red flag.</p><p>The order may have been issued over domestic violence concerns.</p><p>Paul’s long history of throwing up red flags left and right has led many 90 Day Fiance fans to hope that Karine takes baby Pierre and runs.</p><p>Maybe this huge fight that the two had in public mark the end of their relationship. But … we won’t hold our breath.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8sa3UpWSsrJGata2xjJqlnWWblr%2BqusRmnaKfmKl6sLqMoqWsrJGcv6K5jKWgr51dnsButdNmpq%2BdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
