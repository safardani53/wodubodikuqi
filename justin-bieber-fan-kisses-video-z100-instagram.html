The female fan cuddled up to him for a hug and showed off her squeaky voice —&nbsp;likely a result of all the cheering she did outside the radio station earlier that morning&nbsp;— before puckering her lips in an attempt to score a smooch from the superstar. In the video, Justin can be heard saying, “Are you trying to kiss me right now?” before allowing the adoring fan to plant a big one&nbsp;on his cheek. So cute!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://instagram.com/p/6xawjfMz9V/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://instagram.com/p/6xa0-IMz9d/</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, scoring kisses from hardcore&nbsp;fans is hardly a new occurrence&nbsp;for the 21-year-old heart-throb. &nbsp;Back in May 2015, the pop singer&nbsp;gave a private concert at LA’s Lucky Strike, performing some of his biggest hits like “One Less Lonely Girl,” “Baby,” and “Boyfriend” as part of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Make A Wish Foundation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Biebs decided not to post pics from the event on his social media, Instagram photos and YouTube videos provided by fans showed the him&nbsp;posing for pics with the crowd, letting them kiss him and even&nbsp;serenading one special girl. #Swoon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The radio show event is also just the latest in a string of promotional events Justin has been doing in the lead up to the release of his new, yet-untitled album, which is said to drop on Friday, November 13. Prior to that, Justin hit the stage at the inaugural Billboard music festival at the Nikon at Jones Beach Theater on Aug. 23, where he put on arguably one of his best performances to date!&nbsp;Although the singer had a few audio problems, he managed to rock&nbsp;the crowd during his performances of “Boyfriend” and “As Long As You Love Me.” Near the end of his set, Justin slowed things down with a couple of acoustic songs and when it was time to end the show, he performed “Where Are Ü Now” with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Skrillex</a></strong>, 27, and even took his shirt off. So hot!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tell us&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are YOU excited for Justin’s album release? And what did you think of his latest performance?
