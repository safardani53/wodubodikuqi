That’s right, Matt Baier just got married again!
According to E! News, the former Teen Mom star exchanged vows recently in Las Vegas with a woman named Jennifer Conlon.
We don’t know a great deal about Conlon, except she clearly has never tuned in to watch Teen Mom online or on television… lest she would have known to stay far away from her new husband."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We really get each other."</p><p>"We both have overcome a lot of stuff. It felt like the right thing to do. It just kind of happened that way."</p><p>Sounds promising.</p><p>The 46-year old Baier and the 27-year old Portwood had been engaged to get married themselves.</p><p>They had even been planning an October wedding. Yes, as in two months ago, he was preparing to marry someone else.</p><p>But the reality stars broke up while filming Marriage Boot Camp this summer, ending a rocky three-year romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The trouble really started last August.</p><p>That was when reports surfaced that Baier facing legal problems for failing to paying child support to numerous other women for numerous secret biological children.</p><p>(Editor’s Note: Baier and Portwood don’t share any kids, but she’s the mother to eight-year-old Leah with ex Gary Shirley; and she’s pregnant again.)</p><p>It didn’t help the relationship when&nbsp;Portwood&nbsp;then learned that Baier had offered Catelynn Lowell Baltierra a Xanax when she was suffering through a panic attack.</p><p>Despite their many hiccups, however, Baier&nbsp;still had hope for a future with Portwood as recently as August of this year.</p><p>"I’ll hold out hope for a reconciliation," he told E! at the time, elaborating as follows:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends. We started off as best friends and that’s what I miss the most from her: her friendship.</p><p>"To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family."</p><p>This would explain why <a href=#>Baier was devastated</a> over Portwood’s second pregnancy news and perhaps why he reacted the way he did.</p><p>In other words, in jealousy/pain/anger by marrying Conlon.</p><p>Appearing on on Dr. Drew’s podcast in July, Portwood admitted she still talks to Baier, but also that she was working on herself. Not on saving the relationship.</p><p>“I personally am just trying to better myself,” she told the Teen Mom reunion host.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Matt Baier Just Got Married.

"I’m very excited for my future with Andrew and our little family we are starting together!
