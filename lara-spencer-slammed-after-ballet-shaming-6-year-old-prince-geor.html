"And I am deeply sorry."</p><p>She then aired a segment in which she spoke to men who had done ballet about why they loved it — and about the stigma they had faced.</p><p>Lara did a very good job of showing how thoroughly she understood how a few thoughtless words could hurt so many people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>We have to say … it’s not entirely clear if Lara’s screw-up had all that much to do with ballet.</p><p>Listening to her words, it almost sounded as if she were just saying that Prince George has quite a schedule for a six-year-old.</p><p>The fact that she zeroed in on ballet and seemed to mock the idea that George was enthusiastic about it did not go over well.</p><p>If Lara’s intention was to say that he was overburdened for a young child, she could have picked on computer science or religious studies.</p><p>(Note, Prince George may very well become the head of the Church of England at one point, so it’s never too early to start his education on that)</p><p>Regardless of her intentions, it was smart of Lara to not try to "explain away" her words.
