Salary, Net Worth, Career</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-22</div><p><strong>Joey Chestnut</strong> won the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest for the sixteenth time on Monday, July 4. Chestnut won the Fourth of July challenge this year by eating 63 hot dogs in 10 minutes.&nbsp;This is not just his sixteenth victory, but also his eighth in a row. Since 2015, the professional hotdog eater has been on a winning run. Chestnut won the tournament on Monday by a 20 hot dog margin over Geoffrey Espel, who finished second.&nbsp;However, this was not the 37-year-personal old’s best. Last year, Chestnut consumed 76 hot dogs. This is the current Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest record for a time under 10 minutes.</p><h2>What is known about Joey Chestnut’s competitive eating records?</h2><p>Joey Chestnut is the world’s number one competitive eater, according to Major League Eating. Chestnut has many records in competitive food eating apart from the Nathan’s Hot Dog competition.&nbsp;Chestnut owns the record in the following categories, according to Huddle Up:</p><p>“Hard-boiled eggs: 141 in 8 minutes, Glazed donuts: 55 in 8 minutes, Pulled pork sandwiches: 45 in 10 minutes, Taco Bell softshell beef tacos: 53 in 10 minutes, Krystal’s hamburgers: 103 in 8 minutes, Twinkies: 121 in 6 minutes, Chicken wings: 413 in 12 hours, Big Mac sandwiches: 32 in 38 minutes, Tamales: 102 in 12 hours, Grilled cheese sandwiches: 47 in 10 minutes, Ice</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chestnut-2.jpg alt="Joey Chestnut" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Joey Chestnut’s Net Worth</h2><p>While there aren’t many significant medals for eating contests, CelebrityNetWorth estimates Joey Chestnut’s net worth at $2.5 million as of November 2023. Chestnut earned the $10,000 first prize in the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest, and his fifteen years of victories have netted him up to $150,000 in total. According to a Distractify article released in 2020, Chestnut’s principal source of income is competitive eating tournaments. As a result, the 37-year-old Vallejo, California native might be described as a professional eater.</p><p>However, according to his website’s biography page, Joey Chestnut graduated from San Jose State University in 2012 after many years of attendance. The expert eater has a degree in civil engineering and construction management. He took many years to get this degree since he was too busy competing in professional eating events (which he had been doing since 2005).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Joey-Chestnut-1.jpg alt="Joey Chestnut" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, a competitive eater may make between $250,000 and $500,000. However, Chestnut’s profits seem to be far more modest, as seen by his purported riches after 17 years of professional eating tournaments. Of course, the amount will vary depending on the sort of competition and the prize money involved. The most well-known eating competition in the United States provides rewards ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Furthermore, competitive eaters may make money by endorsing restaurant chains, food goods, and even cooking-related things.</p><p>According to the Huddle Up website, Joey Chestnut has endorsement partnerships with Hooters, Hostess, Coney Island IPA, and the acidity medicine Pepto-Bismol. In addition, Chestnut has dabbled in merchandising. The pro-eater offers a variety of sauces, dips, and mustards via his own internet shop. These condiments vary in price from $7.50 per unit to $44 for a six-pack. Chestnut also has a YouTube channel with over 254,000 followers, which is projected to provide a monthly revenue for him.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqK9dp7aktIyiqmain5rGbq%2FHnqqtpqWperSty5qpsmWemsFuw86rq6Flk5a%2FprHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
