The two presumably spent the day with some farm animals prior to the excursion in the woods, as Louis shared several Stories with some calves and turkeys on a farm.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The timeline is a bit murky, but the private couple reportedly began dating in 2017. RadarOnline reported that the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two were first photographed together</a> publicly at the Hammer Museum’s Gala in the Garden in Los Angeles in October 2017. Ashley and Louis have been sporadically spotted out and about around Los Angeles and New York since then, with the most recent public <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>venture being a double date</a> in NYC in March. The duo were photographed holding hands during a stroll following a dinner date with editor-in-chief of W Magazine <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sara Moonves </strong></a>and her partner<strong> Jeff Henrikson</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ashley-olsen-Louis-Eisner-hike-mega-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The machete outing comes a month after Ashley and sister <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mary-Kate Olsen</strong> </a>participated in a rare interview with Vice’s i-D Magazine in June to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their fashion brand, The Row. The private <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sisters opened up about the decision</a> to remain private figures. “We were raised to be discreet people,” Mary-Kate, 35, said. The ethos has also translated over to their fashion line of no-frills, minimalist offerings: “I think that potentially that’s just our aesthetic, our design preference,” Ashley added. “But that doesn’t mean that we don’t also appreciate something truly ornate or maximal.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“We really didn’t want to be in front of [the brand],” Ashley added. “We didn’t necessarily even want to let people know it was us, in a way. I mean, it was one of those things where it was really about the product, to the point where we’re like, ‘Who could we get to kind of front this so we don’t have to?’ I think, to this day, you’ll see we really put the product first.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49yZpqrmKGyunnOpaqepl2Xsqa%2BjKaYnKCVqbJuuM6uoKxllai7pr6MoaCkoZ6cerG0zq2maA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
