The lovebirds further proved their bond is strong when she recently opened up about possibly having another child. “It depends on the month girl!” she laughed in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVE interview with<strong> HollywoodLife</strong></a> last month. “I go through phases… this month is a ‘No.’ Next month might be a ‘Yes.’” Jessie and Eric are already parents of three children, including<strong> Vivianne</strong>, 8, <strong>Eric Jr.</strong>, 6, and<strong> Forrest</strong>, 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BwZqOdo6i2pnnJmqSeq12ZsqS3xKtkm6Gbnruqecqiq62dnp7AqXnFmqqhoZ%2BjerS0zrBkqaGTqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
