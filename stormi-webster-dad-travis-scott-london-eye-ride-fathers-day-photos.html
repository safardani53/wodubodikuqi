She also had her hair in braids and had a starfish painted on her cheek. Travis looked casually cool in a long-sleeved black shirt that had “Listen to Silence” printed on it in white text, long black shorts, gray socks, black sneakers, and a black baseball cap.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Just a few weeks ago, Travis also spent time with Stormi as well as his ex Kylie to celebrate her graduation from preschool. Stormi’s cousins, <strong>Dream Kardashian</strong> and <strong>True Thompson</strong>, were also graduating, so it was a family affair that included <strong>Blac Chyna</strong> and <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>captured photos of the proud parents and their little ones and they all looked like they were having a great time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kylie-jenner-and-stormi-webster-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Travis and Kylie, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>who split</a> 11 months after having their second child, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a son</a>, in Feb. 2022, appeared to get along at the event but “didn’t appear to interact” much during the ceremony, according to TMZ. The two stars have been co-parenting their two children since their breakup and seem to be doing it in a healthy and productive way. After their latest split, a source told<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Us Weekly</a> that they are known to stay friends despite their on-again, off-again relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Kylie and Travis are off again, they were supposed to spend the holidays together, but she went to Aspen to be with her family and friends up there,” the source said. “This has happened so many times before, they’re known to be on again and off again, but always remain friends and great co-parents.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BxZqysn6e6qnnWnpmsrJWneqWtw2arq5mmnsBuv8Koq61lnKS7pbvNZpyynV2ntqWxjJ%2BYraCVp8BusMCyZKmgn6m8tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
