“Lesley Manville, who plays Princess Margaret, and myself were filming, and at lunchtime, we were told we might hear some sad news [about Queen Elizabeth II],” Staunton, 67, revealed on the Friday, December 15, episode of The Graham Norton Show.
When asked whether she wanted to “stop” filming or “carry on,” Staunton chose the latter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She returned to continue filming the series the day after the funeral.</p><p>“I think it was very difficult for people looking at me,” Staunton shared. “I got my head around it, got dressed, but then, we had a lot of [extras] in that day, and then ‘the shape’ walked on. And I think, for them, it was quite hard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Imelda-Staunton-Recalls-Hard-Time-Filming-The-Crown-Season-6-After-Queen-Elizabeth-II-Death-2.jpg><p>Following news of Elizabeth’s passing last year, Netflix announced&nbsp;that production on season 6 <a href=#>would be paused</a> out of respect. “The Crown is a love letter to her and I’ve nothing to add for now, just silence and respect,” show creator <strong>Peter Morgan</strong> said in a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> at the time.</p><p>The Crown season 6, the second half of which premiered on Thursday, December 14, follows more recent years in the British royal family’s history, including <strong>Prince William</strong> and <strong>Princess Kate Middleton</strong>’s first meeting and <strong>King Charles III</strong> and <strong>Queen Camilla</strong>’s 2005 wedding.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last month, executive producer <strong>Suzanne Mackie</strong> revealed that the show’s creative team never planned to take the series <a href=#>beyond the year 2005</a>. “[Peter] always said, ‘I want to end around the time when Camilla and Charles got married,’” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> on November 17. “I always see it in a rather fairy tale way. Like, that’s the end of our journey: Peace is restored to the land, and they lived happily ever after.”</p><p>The series finale pays tribute to Elizabeth’s legacy by featuring a shot of <a href=#>all three actresses</a> who have portrayed her on The Crown. <strong>Claire Foy</strong> and <strong>Olivia Colman</strong>’s versions of the character stand behind Staunton’s Elizabeth following Charles, 75, and Camilla’s wedding celebration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCmnZyZrm6%2F05qsp6yfo3qzscKao6WrXZ2us7CMraCmnV2btq25yKeeZqyYmnqkvs6wpWarlZbAsLqMb2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
