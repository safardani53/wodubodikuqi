But we both love and respect each other tremendously.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>They also cleared the air about any other allegations, including “wrongdoing” in their marriage. “There has been no wrongdoing on anyone’s part,” the reality star and realtor also explained. “Although we are in the public eye, we ask to be able to work through our issues privately. While it may be entertaining to speculate, please don’t create false stories to fit a further salacious narrative.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Did she know all along?! Upon hearing that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’</a>&nbsp;longtime couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong></a> reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split</a> after 27 years of marriage, medium&nbsp;<strong>Allison DuBois</strong> took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>social media</a> to react. As Bravo fans know, the medium appeared in an early episode of Season 1 of the show and predicted that Kyle would get divorced at some point (watch <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>). “I don’t wish Kyle ill, I hope she finds what she’s looking for. I guess I’m the only one who ‘saw’ this coming,” the 51-year-old tweeted on Jul. 3.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t wish Kyle ill, I hope she finds what she’s looking for.

Allison also took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to claim that her phone was “blowing up” after many contacted her after hearing the news of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reported split</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Soon after the medium and author posted her statement on their alleged divorce, many TV fanatics took to the reply section to react to Allison’s words. “Can’t argue with this!”, one fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>quipped</a>, while another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wrote</a>, “you called it.” During the 2011 scene, Allison claimed that Kyle and the real estate mogul would split once <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their kids</a> were “bigger” and that at that point they would “have nothing in common.” One fan took to the comments to highlight that prediction as well. “You were right, and it happened on the timetable you predicted as well. Well played,” they <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>.</p><a title=@stephwithdadeets href=# rel=nofollow>@stephwithdadeets</a><p id=content-paragraph-11>Replying to @Holls2thewalls the crazy psychic is about to get a lot of calls for readings 🤣 <a title=kylerichards href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#kylerichards</a> <a title=rhobh href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#rhobh</a> <a title=rhobhpsychic href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#rhobhpsychic</a> <a title=divorce? href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#divorce?</a> <a title=mauricioumansky href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#mauricioumansky</a> <a title=morganwade href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#morganwade</a> <a title=kyleandmauricio href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#kyleandmauricio</a> <a title=psychic href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#psychic</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><a title="♬ original sound - Stephanie Tleiji" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – Stephanie Tleiji</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Following months of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce rumors</a>, a source claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>on Jul. 3 that the 54-year-old and her hubby were no more. “Kyle and Mauricio have been separated for a while now but are still living under the same roof,” they told the outlet of their relationship. “They remain amicable as they figure out what’s next for them and their family.” The pair, who got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married in 1996</a>, share three daughters: <strong>Alexia</strong>, 27,&nbsp;<strong>Sophia</strong>, 23 and&nbsp;<strong>Portia</strong>, 15.
