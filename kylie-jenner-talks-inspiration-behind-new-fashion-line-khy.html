Magazine</a>, which named Jenner as its brand innovator of the year. “The whole line is really inspired by my personal wardrobe, and the different moods that I’m in,” Jenner told the publication, adding that the first drop is an ode to her unforgettable “King Kylie” era. “[That’s] who I am at my core,” Jenner added.</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>For those who don’t remember the King Kylie days, let Us take a trip down memory lane. This was a time (from about 2013 to 2016) where Jenner was active on Tumblr,&nbsp; the blogging platform founded in 2007, sharing moody snaps that saw her leaning hard into a grunge aesthetic. She often rocked all-black ensembles and gothic makeup. Perhaps the most standout moment from the phase was when she dyed her hair blue-green. (<a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> famously gave Jenner hell for the dye job as she underwent the major hair transformation ahead of the Skim founder’s wedding to <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> in May 2014.)&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kylie-Jenner-Shares-More-Details-on-Fashion-Line-3.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>Jenner was so committed to the bit that she changed her Instagram username to @KingKylie in 2015. While her style has since evolved and her Instagram moniker is now @KylieJenner, the California native has maintained an edgy aura. In August, she was named the face of Acne Studios, appearing in an ad campaign that showed her covered in dark body paint while rocking distressed denim.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>For her line, Jenner explained to WSJ. Magazine that she’s in control. “Creatively I have such a strong vision of what I want to look like and what I want to do and what I want to wear,” she told the publication. “There’s really no one telling me what to do.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Kris Jenner attested to Jenner’s individuality, telling WSJ. that her youngest child has “been the creative director of her life and her wardrobe since she was able to walk.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>Kris, 67, serves as a cofounder of Khy alongside <strong>Emma</strong> and <strong>Jens Grede</strong> — the couple who have also helped create Kim’s <a href=#>Skims</a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>’s <a href=#>Good American</a> and popular denim label Frame.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kylie-Jenner-Shares-More-Details-on-Fashion-Line-2.jpg><p class=p2><span class=s1>According to WSJ., Khy is coming this fall and will unveil pieces by different guest designers.
