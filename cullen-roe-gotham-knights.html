Meet trans actor Tyler DiChiara.</h2><p>Though Staten Island theater kid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyler DiChiara</a> has previously starred in projects like Justin Ward's Relish and Sonia Sebastian's The Virgin of Highland Park, his big break came when he got the Gotham Knights call.</p><p>“When I got the call that I got the part, I was on my way to go to my regular job to be a waiter at California Pizza Kitchen. I was not okay going because that job was just draining me,” he told INTO.</p><p>“So, when I got that call from my agent, I was breaking down into tears. As an actor, that’s the thing that you want to hear, is your team just celebrating you. This career is not stable, but it all worked out in the end and I’m very grateful to be playing Cullen Row on Gotham Knights. It was a very long journey, but we got here.”</p><p>Being the second transgender actor to appear in a superhero CW series —&nbsp;after Nicole Maines, who played Dreamer in <a href=#>Supergirl</a> — Tyler is thrilled to bring LGBTQ+ representation to the small screen.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@tylerdichiara_</span></figure><p>“Seeing someone onscreen who’s like you and you can, just for a moment, go into their world to get away from the world that you’re in, if I can be that moment just for kids or for anyone, I did my job as an actor,” he explained.</p><p>In fact, seeing Emmy-nominated transgender actor and activist <a href=#>Laverne Cox</a> star as inmate Sophia Burset on Orange Is the New Black changed Tyler's world. Not only did Laverne help Tyler understand his own trans identity, but her proud visibility allowed him to believe in his acting dreams.</p><p>"I applaud her so much and if I can help someone realize something, how she helped me, I want to be there for that," he continued.
