Just hours after a psychiatrist detailed Cook’s “sexual issues” and a long list of reasons he should not have custody of his children with Christie Brinkley, the model aired even more of his dirty laundry on the stand.
The supermodel admitted to using a magic marker to draw over Cook’s face in a wedding photo and claimed she would not have married Cook if she had known the truth about his felony drug arrest while he was in his 20s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s how I felt. There was a person I knew I loved and didn’t know where he went,” Christie said about defacing the photo after she learned of her husband’s affair with <a href=#>Diana Bianchi</a>.</p><p style=text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:center>Peter Cook and Christie Brinkley split in 2006 after his now-infamous affair.</p><p>Regarding his arrest, <a href=#>Peter Cook</a> was visibly upset when Brinkley testified that he downplayed the arrest when he revealed it to her a week before their marriage.</p><p>“If I heard the facts as I know today I don’t think I would have gone forward with the marriage,” Christie Brinkley said.</p><p>Peter Cook laughed out loud when she testified that she eventually learned the arrest did not happen in N.Y.C., but in a <strong>gay truck stop</strong>.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span>Cook’s defense attorney grilled <a href=#>Christie Brinkley</a> on her anger toward Cook, which she says she’s kept in check in front of their kids.<p>She argued that she focused on the kids, planning a birthday party for Sailor and taking them to Colorado when the media learned of the split.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s the portrait of a woman enraged and consumed in anger. I believe it’s a portrait of a mother trying to give some normalcy to her children,” she cried out.</p><p>“Are you angry right now?” Cook’s attorney asked in response to her tone.</p><p>She said no, that she was describing her passion for her children, adding it’s the “anger any mother would rightly feel to be falsely accused of things … He’s trying to put the blame on someone else. He’s trying to be the victim.”</p><p><strong>Christie Brinkley was also peppered with questions about her decision to keep the courtroom open to the media during these proceedings</strong>.</p><p>When asked why she did not petition to close the courtroom she said, “in an open courtroom we can get at the real truth.”<br><br>She denied that she pushed for the trial to embarrass Peter Cook.</p><p>“I didn’t want this trial … It’s humiliating for all of us.”</p><p>As he was leaving court for the day, the normally press-shy Peter Cook told a handful of reporters his reaction to his estranged wife’s testimony. “I’m still waiting for the truth she talks about,” he said.</p><p>He added, “No matter what she throws at me, my children love me and I love them and I’m a good father. She can’t take that away.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2lwX2WEcLzErZyrZZOkvKx5zqeanmWXpMFurtSsq56cXZu8s3nDq6ygq12WwW6tjKCYsmWkp8Kkt4ysq6ioXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
