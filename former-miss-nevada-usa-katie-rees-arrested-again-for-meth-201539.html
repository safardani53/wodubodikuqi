According to the police report obtained by the Sun, the officer smelled marijuana and asked if Sims had any weapons or drugs in the car. Sims reportedly hesitated, and officers placed both him and Rees in handcuffs. After searching Sims, whose eyes were allegedly dilated, police found a jar containing GHB, aka liquid ecstasy. In Rees’ bag, police found rolling papers, two smoking pipes, and a canister containing marijuana, Xanax, Oxycontin, and a substance that tested positive for meth.</p><p>The Las Vegas Sun reported that Rees had confessed to smoking earlier in the day but initially lied and said that she was not carrying any drugs on her. The report also notes that Rees’ boyfriend told police, “If you find anything in the car that’s illegal, it’s not hers.”</p><p>Rees is being held on $9,000 bail.
