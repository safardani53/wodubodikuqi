Cliff Sims — who served on the communications team as a special assistant to Trump until 2018 after working on Trump’s presidential campaign — says he remembers meetings in the Oval Office where attendees couldn’t help but stare at the small wooden box, featuring the presidential seal and a red button on the president’s Resolute desk."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m sure many a first-time visitor wondered to themselves,” Sims writes in Team of Vipers, released this week, which gives a critical look at the 2016 campaign and the chaos of the Trump White House.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If Trump noticed someone glancing at the box — and sometimes completely unprompted — he would pick it up and move it farther away from himself,” Sims writes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Sims, Trump would say, “Don’t worry about that. No one wants me to push that button, so we’ll just keep it over here. Now, what were you saying?”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>STR/AFP/Getty; Douglas Gorenstein/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-related-video-another-trump-associate-arrested-in-russia-investigation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Another Trump Associate Arrested in Russia Investigation</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Others would “laugh nervously” and, later in the meeting, the president would bring the button closer to him without any explanation, Sims writes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Out of nowhere, he’d suddenly press the button,” he recalls of Trump. “Not sure what to do, guests would look at one another with raised eyebrows. Moments later, a steward would enter the room carrying a glass filled with Diet Coke on a silver platter, and Trump would burst out laughing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Team of Vipers, Trump enjoyed the ruse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“‘That red button,'” he said, per the book. “‘People never know what to think about the red button! Is he launching the nukes?!'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just like he did when angered by the North Korean leader, Trump used his Twitter account to dismiss Sims.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction,” Trump wrote on Tuesday. “He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. He signed a non-disclosure agreement. He is a mess!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Team of Vipers, Sims writes that most visitors would laugh at the president’s joke with his red button. But it was also a revealing moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The prank offered a subtle sense of self-awareness,” he writes, “there were people who thought Trump was volatile enough to start a nuclear war.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, his tweet about nuclear war in January 2018, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was met with notable outcry</a> on social media, including from TV host Stephen Colbert and retired astronaut Mike Kelly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Please … don’t start a nuclear war,” Colbert wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Sims, he wrote Team of Vipers based on “hundreds of pages of notes” taken in real time and from in-person interactions with the president and other staffers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And one of the most “memorable” red-button moments occurred when Dr. Ben Carson, Trumps secretary of housing and urban development, visited the Oval Office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Carson outlined his vision for a department that would be focused on literacy, Trump drank his Diet Coke, according to Sims. But the president started “to lose interest” during the meeting that lasted approximately 10 minutes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“At some point [Trump] noted his Diet Coke was nearly gone and went back to his button routine, but his heart wasn’t quite in it this time. ‘People always wonder about this button,’ [Trump] told a confused Carson,” Sims writes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Trump successfully summoned a fresh drink, he told Carson, “That sounds wonderful, Ben,” according to Sims. “‘I trust you to do it right.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had no idea what Trump had just approved, and I’m not sure he did, either,” Sims writes. “But he stood up, signaling the meeting was coming to an end.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaJyfo66tsIytqa6loGK%2FprCMp6ycpJWWv26u1K2rqKZdmbK0t44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
