Back in November, she responded to a tweet that included a video of someone dressing up as her and doing an Ariana impression. The resemblance was uncanny, but Ariana could not get behind the context of the video. “I just wonder whyyyy the Cat [Valentine] voice/dialogue,” she wrote. “I am sure she is the sweetest sweet sweetheart forreal!! But it’s definitely bizarre seeing people blend the two worlds.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>YALL LOOK AT WHAT ARIANA JUS SAID ABT THE TIKTOK WANNABES. she doesn’t like it. y’all needa stop. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/qQo6gk3jv8</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— daniella (@povbutera) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 23, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Ariana played Cat on the hit Nickelodeon series from 2010 until 2013.
