His death left many questions unanswered about what led him to violently take her life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Tonight, a new 20/20, airing at 9:01 to 11 ET on ABC (next day on Hulu), goes in-depth on the disturbing twists and turns of the case, including shocking details about the contents of the handwritten journal Ray kept while he was on the run. (An exclusive clip is shown below.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Part memoir, part spy thriller,” says ABC News 20/20 co-anchor Deborah Roberts, the 18-page journal details “the full version of what he says happened the day he killed his live-in girlfriend, Angela Bledsoe.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the two-hour special, forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland analyzes the journal, which Ray titled “On the Move,” saying, “There’s no sense of being disturbed by what he’s done.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Calling Ray’s writings “very calculated,” she says. “There is a definite urge to control exactly how people are going to understand this.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to keep up with the latest&nbsp;crime coverage?

There they found her on the kitchen floor suffering from gunshot wounds, which claimed her life several hours later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By then, Ray, in his black BMW, was miles away, after fleeing the scene.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a letter Ray wrote to his brother and left in his daughter’s suitcase after he dropped the girl off at the brother's house, he said he shot and killed Bledsoe in what he claimed was self-defense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After leaving his car at Newark Liberty International Airport, he took a cab to Philadelphia, before hitchhiking across the country to Mexico, police said.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He was arrested as he tried to enter Cuba.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t think James Ray ever thought he was coming back to face a court and a jury in Essex [County], New Jersey,” News Channel 12 New Jersey reporter Chris Keating says in the special.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prosecutor Michele Miller tells Roberts in the special that the diary played an important part in convicting Ray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You compare it to the evidence you have,” Miller says, “and you are able to&nbsp;corroborate or contradict what he is claiming.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ray faced a sentence of 30 years to life before he died.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two-hour special includes interviews with Bledsoe’s daughter, who is now 11; Ray and Gaynelle Bledsoe, Bledsoe's parents; Lisa LaBoo and Diedre Hill, Bledsoe's sisters; Brooke Dean, Angela’s cousin; Sgt.
