At the beginning of the series, the family lived in a farmhouse that was located in Barnesville. They spent years renovating it before they decided to call it quits and move out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Currently, the Johnstons live in a huge house in Forsyth. The house's listing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trulia</a> says that it was built in 2005 and consists of 3,660 square feet on 9.47 acres. It has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a pool. It's described as "incredibly secluded" and it used to be owned by an "Atlanta Brave Legend." They paid $417,000 for it in 2017.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some of the Johnston kids have moved out of their parents' home.</h2><p>Three of Trent and Amber's kids are adults and currently, two of them are living outside of their parents' home. Elizabeth got her own apartment first. Anna moved out not too long after her sister, and she also resided in an apartment apart from her parents — that is, until <a href=#>she purchased her first house in 2023</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although Jonah moved out of his parents' house for a while, he temporarily moved back home in 7 Little Johnstons Season 12. "Amber and I made the decision to have Jonah move back home because things were not going well for him," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trent explained on the show</a>. "Jonah was not living a responsible life, he was not being productive."</p><p>"And we've got to get a handle of it and get it fixed," Amber added. "Because the kid has an immense amount of potential."</p><p>Amber went on to explain they were putting Jonah's belongings in storage, and that the ultimate goal was to get Jonah back on his feet so that he could again live in his own place.</p><p>"It's time for a reset, honestly," Jonah told producers. "It's time for me to find my bearings again, straighten my lifestyle out a little bit, seek help — all of the above."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Hopefully, Jonah is able to regroup and leave the nest again in the near future.
