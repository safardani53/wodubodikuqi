To start, you'll want to make sure you have access to a stove, either by having one in your home or by borrowing the one at Chez Remy.

You can use any fish that you obtain by fishing in the waters, while basil and tomato are both ingredients that can be grown in your garden.</p><p>Once you have one of each of these items, you can begin the cooking process.</p><p>To make the fish steak, you'll want to interact with the stove. Choose the fish, tomato, and basil from your inventory and drop them in the pot. Select "Start cooking" (which will use one of the coal in your inventory) and voila! You officially have a fish steak.</p><p>Once you've made this recipe once, it'll unlock in your recipe book, allowing you to make it as many times as you'd like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKaZm5p6p7XSoWSsrJWWuG6wyKylnrFdmb%2BmrcyloKCgpGLDorjLnrA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
