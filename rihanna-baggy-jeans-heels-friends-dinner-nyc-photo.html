She accessorized her look with the new Tiffany & Co. Lock Bangle, in addition to a Tiffany HardWear necklace and bracelet. Rihanna carried a bright red clutch purse which matched the color of her lipstick. The Barbados-born star, who let her dark hair down for the night out, smiled at the cameras and seemed to be having a blast with her friends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>RiRi and her boyfriend <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A$AP Rocky</a></strong>, 33, have enjoyed nights out here and there since becoming parents in May. On Aug. 24, the couple stepped out for a date night in NYC, where Rihanna wore an <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>all-green outfit</a> that included a miniskirt and a matching dark green button-dow. Rocky wore a black vest over a matching pair of jeans plus black boots. The lovebirds adorably held hands as they left the Ned Hotel to enjoy a night to themselves.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Now that she’s got a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>newborn baby</a>, Rihanna’s plans to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>release new music</a> have been put on the back burner. Her last album, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Anti</a>, came out back in 2016 and fans have been clamoring for new music from the superstar. However, a source recently told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that Rihanna is mainly focused on&nbsp;motherhood for the time being. “Right now, her focus is on soaking up the blessing of being a new mom and bonding as a little family with Rocky,” the source said. “He’s been such an incredible partner, he’s busy with shows and getting his album ready but if he’s not working, he’s by her side.” The insider added, “He completely worships her, he’s so devoted to her and to their son, she couldn’t have found a better partner, they are very happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49rZquhmJa7r62Mm5ign6lit6atzaxkoZ2VocBustGinKeco2KxqrrNnqlmpqmYerG0zq2maA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
