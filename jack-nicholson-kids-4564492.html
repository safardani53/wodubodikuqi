After their split, Jennifer was raised in Hawaii by her mother. She later attended the University of Southern California where she studied art.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jack-Nicholson-kids-Jennifer-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Her formal education lead to a career in interior design, which also included a refresh of her father’s iconic home on Mulhullond Drive.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jennifer later on went on to pursue a successful career as a fashion designer — but confessed that her last name came with “pressure” others didn’t understand.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I like being Jack Nicholson’s daughter and I’m proud of him, but people don’t understand the pressures that come along with that,” she said in a past interview. She previously showed her collections at L.A. Fashion Week and in 2013, opened her own boutique in the Venice area that sold both her own designs and other California brands.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Like her dad, Jennifer also pursued a career in acting: her father financed 1990 flick&nbsp;Blue Champagne, and she later appeared in 1994’s&nbsp;Inevitable Grace.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Jennifer tried to be an actress at some point and worked in “Blue Champagne,” a 1990 film her father financed for her, but that did not see the light of day. In 1994, she worked on a psychological thriller called “Inevitable Grace.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>The brunette married ex-husband <strong>Mark Norfleet</strong> in 1997, who she met at the Punahou School in Honolulu. The pair welcomed son <strong>Sean</strong> in 1996, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Duke</strong></a> in 1999. Jennifer divorced Mark in 2003. Notably, Duke was romantically linked to <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bella Hadid.</a></strong></p><h2>Caleb James Goddard</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Caleb is Jack’s son with late actress <strong>Susan Anspach</strong> born on September 26, 1970. The actors met on the set of Five Easy Pieces&nbsp;in 1969, and began a romantic relationship shortly after. Jack denied Caleb was his for many years, and he was later adopted by Lost In Space&nbsp;actor Mark Goddard (Mark and Susan married in 1970, but divorced in ’78).</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Caleb stayed out of the public eye for most of his childhood, however, it was later confirmed he studied at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Like his parents, he pursued a career in both film and television: he has dabbled in acting, and also worked as a writer and producer in New York City.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>While Caleb maintained his stepfather’s last name, it’s believed Jack began to provide financial support for him in the mid-80s. Nicholas later acknowledged Caleb as his son in a 1996 interview with&nbsp;People&nbsp;magazine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The acknowledgement came after Susan was upset following a 1994 profile in&nbsp;Vanity Fair that included no mention of her son. “Jack would say, ‘I didn’t have a father and I’m a superstar, it didn’t hurt me,'” Anspach said after. “And I would say, ‘But you didn’t have to see your father on every corner… You are too famous to do this. It’s unkind,” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Caleb also opened about reconnecting with his dad. “Jack told me that… he never liked my mom,” he said. “He further said that my mom had tried to use the press against him, that the press didn’t matter once you got to court,” he added. Caleb has also been seen at basketball games with his biological father.</p><h2>Honey Hollman</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Honey Hollman was born in January 1, 1981 to former Miss Scandinavia Winnie Hollman and Jack . The pair are believed to have had an affair while in Denmark, where Honey was born (Jack was in a relationship with <strong>Anjelica Huston</strong> at the time).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jack-Nicholson-kids-Honey-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-19>Honey is the most private of Jack’s brood, spending the majority of her life in Europe. She has, however, pursued acting and appeared in Danish film Empire North back in 2006.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Despite the distance between Honey and her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Academy Award winning</a> father, Jack has always kept a relationship with Honey via phone.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>The actress married <strong>Peter Duffy</strong> and the two live a quiet life in the Irish town of Trim, where they own a publ. She reportedly has three children with Duffy.</p><h2>Lorraine Nicholson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>Lorraine Nicholson was born on April 16, 1990 to Jack and ex Rebecca Broussard. The 32-year-old was raised in Los Angeles, and studied acting at Brown University.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Like her dad, Lorraine is an actor. The blonde made her big screen debut alongside Jack in 2003’s&nbsp;Something’s Gotta Give&nbsp;as Samantha Newman when she was only 13. She later had a role in biopic Soul Surfer, based on the book with<strong> Bethany Hamilton</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jack-Nicholson-kids-Lorraine-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-24>“My dad told me, ‘The only goal you should have when you start out is to get people to want to work with you again,’ because if you get the opportunities to try, you’ll get better,” she said in a&nbsp;Town & Country&nbsp;interview back in 2017. When asked what she’s learned from observing her dad, she shared, “that it’s really important to live a fulfilled life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Lorraine has been by Jack’s side at events for years, most often <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>courtside at Los Angeles Lakers games</a>.</p><h2>Ray Nicholson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Ray Nicholson is the second child born to Jack and Rebecca, entering the world on February 20, 1992. Like his sister Lorraine, Ray was raised in Los Angeles. He later attended the prestigious Cinematic Arts school at the University of Southern California, where he appeared on school productions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jack-Nicholson-kids-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-27>Like his sister and dad, Ray has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>become an actor</a> and appeared in several projects including television series&nbsp;Panic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jack-Nicholson-kids-Ray-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-28>In Oct. 2021, Ray was seen with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father at a Lakers game</a> — marking Jack’s first public appearance in two years.</p><h2>Tessa Gourin</h2><p id=content-paragraph-31>While Jack has never publicly acknowledged Tessa as his daughter, it has been claimed that the 28-year-old actress was born from an affair that&nbsp;The Bucket List&nbsp;star had with then-20-year-old waitress Jenine Gourin. Despite being described as the “spitting image” of Jack by&nbsp;The Daily Beast, Tessa explained that she didn’t have a strong connection with her dad. “My mom wanted me to have a relationship with him, but he said he wasn’t interested,” she told the outlet.&nbsp;“When you’re a child, you don’t have a choice where you’re going, so if your mom is pushing you on someone who’s technically your father and he agrees to see you for anywhere between one hour and a couple of days, that’s where you’re going to go. I don’t know this person very well, we’ll just say that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>Despite a limited relationship, Tessa is also an actress, having appeared in&nbsp;Stranger’s Arms&nbsp;and the short&nbsp;The Crusaders,&nbsp;per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. She also said she never spoke to her dad about acting, but she did open up about the struggles she faces as an actress in a February 2023 op-ed for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Newsweek</a>,&nbsp;where she spoke about the frustrating conversation about “nepo-babies” in the entertainment industry. “Having grown up without my father, I’ve sat on the sidelines and watched in frustration as other celebrity children have seamlessly secured roles or been signed to huge agencies,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-33>Even though the connection with her dad is limited, Tessa hasn’t&nbsp; shied away from the fact that she thinks he’s “one of the greatest actors of all time,” as she put it in&nbsp;Newsweek. She further spoke about how she still admires his work in&nbsp;The Daily Beast&nbsp;interview. “If I were to discredit anything about his acting, then that wouldn’t make me an artist, because making art and being the world’s greatest dad are not the same thing,” she told the outlet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mamqRlnp6wqbvLrKanZZuesbR5k25tbWxpZ3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
