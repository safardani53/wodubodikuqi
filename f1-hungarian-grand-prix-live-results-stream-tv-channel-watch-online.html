And bit by bit as we got through the next couple of stints the car started to become more drivable.</p><p>"But I'm going to take the positives from yesterday, amazing from the team to get to where we were and to beat everybody in qualifying was really spectacular for us and while it shows we don't have the best car it was an incredible lap.</p><p>"We have a lot of work to do, it looks like we are a long way from the Red Bull in a race and now we are behind the McLaren but we just got to keep pushing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-mercedes-lewis-hamilton-race-833668026-1.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Red Bull upgrade impact</h3><p>As if they needed to be any quicker.</p><p>Verstappen's +33.7 second win today was the biggest margin of the season so far.</p><p>The Bulls brought upgrades to the Hungaroring which were rumoured to make them two tenths quicker.</p><p>While qualifying was far from ideal, the race was routine for them with Perez also recovering to P3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH90fJhuaGloX5t%2BbrTUp56aqpmWu26z0ZqlnWWgp7a5ecuirZ5loprAtrjTrGSsrKKarq55069knKCRo7umuIywmK2bmGK8r7jIp5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
