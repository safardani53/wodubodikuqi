In fact, unless the sound of aggressive swearing and whiney teenage sulking is sweet music to your ears then you probably don’t like anyone on the show.
Apart from Kailon Davis that is.
Unlike Bobby Brown, who proved a fan favourite during series 3 but was eventually booted out of Independence Community College in season 4 due to stealing allegations, Kailon stays true to the school programme despite learning disabilities."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He dangerously prodded coach Brown with the question “hey coach, do you know you look like Adam Sandler?'” and bamboozled his teacher on several occasions.</p><p>Struggling to read the whiteboard, Heather asked Kailon where his reading glasses were to which he honestly and bluntly replied:</p><p>“In the microwave.”</p><h3>Kailon on Twitter</h3><p>Something we didn’t know about Kailon during his time on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Netflix</span></a> show was the death of his sister.
