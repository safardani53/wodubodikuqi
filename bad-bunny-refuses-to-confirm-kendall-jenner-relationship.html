Never. About anything.”</p><p>The singer asserted that his personal life is no one’s business and he doesn’t have to put up with the backlash he receives even though he’s in the public eye.</p><p>“I don’t have to accept anything and everything because I wanted to be an artist,” Bad Bunny explained. “At the end of the day, you listen to me because you want to. I don’t force you to.”</p><p>Bad Bunny was first linked to Jenner, 27, in February when they were photographed leaving Wally’s in Beverly Hills. The following month, they were seen on another outing — which <a href=#>appeared to end with a kiss</a>.</p><p>“Things are not official between Kendall and Bad Bunny, but they’re seeing each other on a regular basis and getting to know each other better,” a source told Us Weekly in March, noting that Jenner wasn’t “really looking to date anybody” following <a href=#>her 2022 split</a> from <a href=#><strong>Devin Booker</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Bad-Bunny-Not-Interested-In-Confirming-Kendall-Jenner-Relationship-2.jpg><p>When attending a <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a> concert in August, the pair were spotted <a href=#>packing on some major PDA</a>. At the time, a source told Us that Jenner and Bad Bunny’s “<a href=#>connection has grown even stronger</a>” throughout their time together.</p><p>“Kendall has been getting much closer with Bad Bunny over the past several months,” the insider added. “Things were more casual when they first started dating, but after a short period of time she saw long-term potential in their relationship.”</p><p>That same month, Bad Bunny posted an Instagram Story in which he was wearing a necklace that <a href=#>featured a “K” pendant</a> — seemingly referring to his relationship with Jenner. The same piece of jewelry was also featured in his Vanity Fair cover story. However, it was noted that his publicist asked him to take it off before any photographs were taken.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It used to be a guy with a camera and a flash and they f–k with your eyes like that. Nowadays, everybody is a paparazzo,” Bad Bunny shared in the interview. “Everyone is taking photos, everyone is recording.”</p><p>He added: “Nobody respects anybody’s privacy, and not only my privacy as a celebrity, but yours.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZRir7a6zbJkq52WqsCmv4ytpmabn6Ozqr7MZqKeppSWua15yZ6lp52iYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
