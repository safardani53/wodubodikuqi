Me, Myself, Jimin’s ID: Chaos’ Special 8 Photo-Folio is the title of his photofolio. Of course, ARMYs have reacted to the Filter singer’s new photographs on social media, and we adore it. Other fans turned the incident into a meme, with Jin having the “most relatable” reply to the Serendipity singer. Me, Myself, and Jimin, HYBE’s debut concept video for his picture portfolio, was published on September 26. The Promise singer exhibited his magnificent visuals in the concept video, displaying a peaceful vibe and his trademark duality in all its grandeur.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BTSs-Jimin.jpeg alt="BTS's Jimin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The BTS member picked the black and white hues in the previously published mood sampler because they reflect two opposing sides of the same coin. He also said in the video that he wants to offer people a fresh side of him that is still essentially him without any extra “ornaments.”</p><h2>BTS Jimin’s Louvre picture will be displayed in his family’s Busan café.</h2><p>A collection of artwork inspired by the Promise vocalist and created by the accomplished South Korean artist Lee K was shown in the Louvre museum in Paris and is currently proudly displayed at Magnate café in Busan, which is owned by the BTS member’s father.&nbsp;Artist Lee K personally hung the Filter singer’s photos at his family-owned café on September 22. For the uninitiated, his magnificent image was shown by artist Lee K inside the Carrousel du Louvre at this year’s Focus Art Fair, which ran from September 1 to 4.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BTSs-Jimin.jpg alt="BTS's Jimin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fans who were unable to attend Paris may now see the gorgeous image at his family-owned café in Busan. ARMYs also express how delighted the BTS member’s father must be to have his images displayed in the café. On October 13, the Promise vocalist will celebrate his birthday, and the band will play in Busan’s Asiad stadium to assist South Korea to win the bid for the “2030 World Expo.”</p><p></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>BTS's Jimin</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>K-Pop Idol</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZraujYrequcinqmarpKq7r7XNoGSanaOptabAyJyqZq6ZqMKiuIyhmK%2BdXamurLHNZqavnaJiwamxjKKlrZ2io7K1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
