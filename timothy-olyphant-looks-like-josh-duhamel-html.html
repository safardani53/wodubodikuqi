Obviously, the Christmas card went to many of Olyphant's friends and family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This, as Olyphant disclosed, was an incident from the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>Olyphant was supposedly hearing his friends ask him&nbsp;if he knew&nbsp;a guy named "Josh Duhamel." Of course, he did. The two even had friends in common.</p><p>Others would straight-up mistake him for Duhamel. Admittedly, his wife loved when people did that.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Olyphant also shared that this went both ways, and Duhamel was also very often mistaken for the TV personality.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Josh Duhamel posing&nbsp;for&nbsp;Timothy Olyphant's family Christmas card.&nbsp;</strong>(Source: YouTube)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Despite all the clamor about how one looks like the other, the two had never really met until a charity game in Dodger Stadium.&nbsp;</p><p>As Olyphant recalled, there was nothing but laughter when they first saw each other. Olyphant considered the laughter as a release for the years and years of mistaken identity that the two had endured between them.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Because Olyphant's entire family was right there, he asked for Duhamel to click a picture with them and later used the same picture for his family's Christmas card with a note that read,&nbsp;</p><p>"Happy holidays from all the Olyphants and Josh!" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>'I thought he looked taller'</h2><p>So, during the holidays, Olyphant got a call from his brother, who was visiting their mom at the time.</p><p>She apparently had the Christmas card on the refrigerator with all the other cards, and when her other son took notice, she said, "Don't they look great?"&nbsp;</p><p>So his brother had to break the news to his mother that it wasn't him in that photo, it was someone who looks like him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When his mom peeked into the photo, she went, "I thought he looked taller."</p><p>That was a justified response, though. As per an article from <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Decider</a>, it was not at all surprising if the two of them were frequently mistaken for one another because of how much the one looks like the other.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the only discerning factor between the two of them was their height.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The outlet reported Olyphant was six feet tall, a tad bit shorter than&nbsp;Duhamel, who stands at the height of 6' 3 1/2".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyZory1tNhmpqWxoJ2ur8CMpaaoo6Niuaq3xGahqKuYYrG2tMCmnKVmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
