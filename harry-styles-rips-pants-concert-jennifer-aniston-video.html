Meanwhile, Harry kept his cool after ripping his pants, getting right back up and continuing the performance. He tried to cover up the ripped area with one hand as he finished the song, and had a grin on his face as he realized what had happened in front of thousands of fans. He eventually was able to change into new trousers to complete the concert.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A JENNIFER ANISTON <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/ZWvjJqkqfE</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>‚Äî duda.
