Last month, she took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> and showed off a maxi dress featuring <a href=#>a black knit top</a> finished with long sleeves and a mock net that was attached to a pleated ivory skirt. At the time, she posed in front of a mirror while moving the skirt around to show how light-weight and flowy it is. ‚ÄúThis may or may not be coming spring ‚Äì SRG,‚Äù she captioned the video.</p><p>Although she has not yet announced the release date of her collection, she‚Äôs been open about what fans can expect. ‚ÄúThe <a href=#>aesthetic is very my vibe</a>,‚Äù she gushed to Who What Wear in August. ‚ÄúI made sure trying on <a href=#>every single sample</a>, that it embodies the aesthetic that I‚Äôve been wearing. It‚Äôs 100% me.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Richie also shared that watching her older sister,<a href=#><strong> Nicole Richie</strong></a>, design inspired her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve watched Nicole design for years with House of Harlow, and it has definitely been inspiring for me. I‚Äôve taken notes, and I‚Äôve learned a lot.‚Äù</p><p>Similarly to Nicole, Sophia isn‚Äôt planning to be the face of the brand. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to be people that just throw our names on things. We can be passionate and be involved.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp5aerm6%2ByJyfop1dnru0vMirnKxlpah6uLXToWShnaJis6K4y2amrqyWnsG0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
