Peter has a few wardrobe changes in No Way Home, which opened in theaters on Friday, Dec. 17, and already boasts the third-biggest box office opening of all time, with more than $253 million in box office receipts so far, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By the <a href=#>end of the movie</a>, however, Spidey is rocking a classic look. We’re recapping how Peter suits up in the new movie, but beware: <strong>Spider-Man: No Way Home</strong><strong> spoilers ahead!</strong></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Peter Parker wears a variety of Spidey suits in ‘No Way Home,’ and by the end, he goes back to basics.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a>, Peter spends much of No Way Home in the red-and-black suit he crafted from Tony Stark’s technology in the previous Spidey movie, Spider-Man: Far From Home.</p><p>When he encounters baddies Electro and Sandman, however, he’s clad in a black-and-gold Spider-Man suit, which is actually the red-and-black suit turned inside out.

What if Tony Stark makes Peter’s suit?’ And as soon as he said that, I understood the possibilities of what we could do together,” Amy said. “To have Iron Man and Spidey in the same world, one rooted more in technological innovation — the new suit — and less in medical experimentation, which is where we were confined before, felt so much more modern.”</p><p>And though No Way Home marks the end of one Spider-Man trilogy, Amy and Kevin are already thinking about the character’s cinematic future. “We’re actively beginning to develop where the story heads next,” Kevin tells the Times.</p><p>Adds Amy, “At the end of the movie we just made, you see Spider-Man make a momentous decision, one that you’ve never seen him make before. It’s a sacrifice. And that gives us a lot to work with for the next film.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL2qsMSrZKaZnmK7psOMrKyirF2jvG7DwLJkoaedmg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
