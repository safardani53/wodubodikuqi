To find those simple moments that we all want on a cold Christmas night.” Now, that’s romantic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Speaking of romance, we all know and love Sam from his days as Gunnar Scott on&nbsp;Nashville, but now that it’s no longer on the air, he revealed we’ll be getting new music from Sam, as himself, not Sam as Gunnar! “I’m kicking off 2019 with a show at the Roundhouse in London on Jan. 28, and it’s a great way to start the year and introduce my new music,” Sam said. He also said he was absolutely open to collaborating with his former co-stars, like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nashville-based <strong>Lennon Stella</strong></a>, who just released her EP&nbsp;Love, me. “She’s so talented,” Sam complimented. “From such a young age on set, she and Maisy (Stella) were just filled with talent! I love what she’s doing.” We can expect Sam to stick to his Country/Americana roots when it comes to new music in 2019, and who knows, maybe he’ll release a Christmas album?
