I didn’t see a glint of it in her eyes and I wanted that — done feeling wretched about who I am.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In Juno, Elliot played the main character of the same name while Olivia played the character’s best friend. The actor went on to write that he thought his co-star was “older, capable, and centered,” even though they were the same age, and their physical intimacy happened in all kinds of different places, including “her hotel room, in our trailers at work, once in a tiny, private room in a restaurant …”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Olivia-Thirlby-1st-Pics-Elliot-Page-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Olivia has yet to respond to the comments Elliot made, but she is now married to <strong>Jacques Pienaar</strong>. They said “I do” in 2014 and she came out as bisexual two years before that. “Loving people is a necessary part of being human, and it is very difficult to love people in secret,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brooklyn Magazine</a>. “And I am not one hundred percent straight.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BrZqikmau2onnToaCrpJKuerDB06KloGWWnr%2B0wIypn6isn6h6prjLoqatZaCWtKZ50p6vZqKlo7xuv8StZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
