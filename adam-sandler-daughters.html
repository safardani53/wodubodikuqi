Many people know Adam Sandler as the comedy legend behind classic films like Big Daddy, The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, Happy Gilmore, and Grown Ups, but when he's not making people laugh, he's a devoted father of two. He wed Jackie Sandler in 2003 after five years of dating, and the pair has since welcomed two daughters together, Sadie and Sunny."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Adam and Jackie welcomed Sadie in 2006, and their second daughter, Sunny, was born in 2008. They both have speaking roles in Hubie Halloween.</p><p>Hubie Halloween centers around Hubie Dubois (Adam Sandler), who keeps an eye on the crimes going on in his home town of Salem during the Halloween season.</p><p>Adam's daughter Sadie plays high school student Danielle in the film. Her character also happens to be the daughter of Violet Valentine (Julie Bowen), who is Hubie's love interest. Her first appearance in the film can be seen at around the 16-minute mark.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadie and Sunny are on-screen sisters as well, as the latter girl plays the elementary-school-aged Cooky. The two also share an on-screen brother named Tommy (who is played by Stranger Things actor Noah Schnapp).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to having prominent roles in the spooky Netflix flick, the sisters have also notably appeared in The Wrong Missy, Murder Mystery, the Hotel Transylvania series, the Grown Ups franchise, Pixels, The Do-over, and Sandy Wexler, among other Adam Sandler comedies.&nbsp;</p><p>Their mom, Jackie Sandler appears in Hubie Halloween as Tracy Phillips.&nbsp;</p><p>Adam's daughters (and wife) also scored roles in his 2023 Netflix film You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah!, marking it as yet another family affair (in the film industry, that is). Sadie plays the role of Ronnie Friedman while Sunny plays Stacey Friedman, a boy-crazed teen who is planning an “epic” bat mitzvah with her best friend. Jackie was also cast in the movie, playing the role of Gabi Rodriguez.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adam Sandler shared that his daughters were close to the late actor Cameron Boyce.</h2><p>While Adam's Halloween film has gotten a lot of attention online (and it was trending on Netflix within a few hours of its release), it's a somewhat bittersweet release for the actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron Boyce, who passed away from complications related to epilepsy in July of 2019, was set to star in Hubie Halloween as Hubie's co-worker, Deli Mike. Adam shared that Cameron was set to begin filming just two days after his death.

"Gone way too soon and one of the kindest, coolest, funniest, and most talented kids we knew. You live on forever in our hearts and are truly missed every day."</p><p>When he was just 11 years old, Cameron played Adam's son in the 2010 movie Grown Ups.

"He was just a great kid, and everybody misses him."</p><p>Can you catch all of the celebrity cameos in Hubie Halloween?
