The rest of the theme appeared to be farmhouse inspired, with a sign that read “baby, i love u” — seemingly in reference to the 2003 track from her This Is Me…Then&nbsp;album inspired by Ben. The rest of the sign read “Jennifer [hearts] Ben” and “heart + soul.” Other images showed rustic wooden chairs and tables arranged for the reception, surrounding a gorgeous four-tier cake, as well as velvet furniture accents.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Guests reportedly stayed at the ritzy Perry Lane Hotel in Savannah, and were spotted mingling in the lobby ahead of the nuptials per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “Guests were gathering at The Perry Lane Hotel [in Savannah] to head to Jennifer and Ben’s wedding, There,” an eyewitness told the digital arm of the show, revealing that hotel staff opened a bottle of champagne prior to the departure via white trolley buses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-married-backgrid-post2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Everyone is dressed in white with most women in white dresses and gowns, and most men in white suits, a majority in linen material, but the dress code features a wide variety.
