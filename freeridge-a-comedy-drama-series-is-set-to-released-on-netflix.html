Overall, the teaser retains a unique and adventurous tone that young comedy lovers will undoubtedly like. According to Netflix’s Tudum, here’s a brief synopsis of the upcoming series:</p><p>“Gloria (Keyla Monterroso Mejia), Ines (Bryana Salaz), Demi (Ciara Riley Wilson), and Cam (Tenzing Norgay Trainor) are your new Core Four, sure to fall into a mind-bending mystery — and, maybe, a little puppy love — when they come upon a box that may or may not be cursed.”</p><p>According to the official description and teaser for Freeridge, viewers can expect a funny comedy series that follows the adventures of four close friends who unwittingly set off a curse that seems to have come back to haunt them. The series will supposedly include eight episodes, all of which will be released on Netflix on the same day, February 2, 2023.</p><p></p><h2>A short glance at the cast of Freeridge</h2><p>Keyla Monterroso Mejia plays Gloria, the group’s dynamic and seductive leader, in one of the primary roles in the comedy series. She is characterized as “unapologetically herself,” and she is incredibly educated and sophisticated.&nbsp;Keyla looks fantastic in the part, effortlessly embodying her character’s essential characteristics. Viewers may expect a totally outstanding performance from the very skilled actress.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Freeridge-2.jpg alt=Freeridge width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Keyla Monterroso Meijo is most recognized for her roles in HBO’s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Abbott Elementary, and The Estate, among others.&nbsp;Bryana Salaz, who plays the part of Ines, co-stars with Keyla in another crucial role.
