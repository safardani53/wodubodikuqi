Where Is He From?</h2><p>Valeri Bure was born Valeri Vladimirovich “Val” Bure on June 13, 1974, in Moscow, Russia, Soviet Union.</p><p>He is the younger son of his father, Vladimir, and mother, Tatiana Bure. Also, Valeri is the brother of a professional ice hockey player, Pavel Bure.</p><p>Vladimir originally came from Furna, Switzerland, and was an Olympic swimmer with four medals.</p><p>Similarly, Bure’s ancestors were craftsmen and watchmakers and were granted noble status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/valeri-005.jpg><p>Valeri was just nine years old when his parents separated. After that, he moved to North America with his father and brother, who was playing for the Vancouver Canucks in the NHL then.</p><p>However, his mother joined them two years later, and the whole family settled in Los Angeles, where Vladimir continued training him and his brother.</p><p>But by 1998, the two brothers became estranged from their father and his second family. None of them revealed the real reason for it.</p><h2>Age And Body Measurements</h2><p>Having practiced a healthy lifestyle during his professional years, it has become a habit for this retired hockey player to keep his body fit. As a result, even after retiring, Valeri is youthful and healthy.</p><p>During his NHL days, Bure needed to have a robust physique, as we all know how physical the sport can be.</p><p>As per the NHL’s official site, he stands tall at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 meters) and weighs around 81.6 kg (180 pounds).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/valeri-003.jpg><p>His years of training on ice and maintaining his diet have helped him achieve a lot during his time on the ice.</p><p>The former NHL player was born in 1974, making him 49 years old. He celebrates his birthday on June 13 every year, and his sun sign is Gemini.</p><p>And from what we know, people of this sign are outgoing, smart, and free-spirited.</p><h2>Personal Life And Wedding</h2><p>When they first met, Valeri and Candace were both young but accomplished in their careers.</p><p>The young lovers met at the 3rd Annual Rock ‘N the Puck Celebrity Hockey Game, where Candance’s on-screen uncle, Dave Coulier, set them up. Talking with the Today, Candace re-called how she met Val.</p><p>She said, “Dave Coulier, who played Joey on Full House, is a big hockey fan, was at a celebrity charity game playing, and he invited the cast down. He pulled me over to the side and said, ‘I met this really cute Russian hockey player, and I want to introduce you.'”</p><p>To this, she added, “Val had just come from Moscow, Russia, and it turned out he would watch Full House to learn English.”</p><p>The two instantly clicked and started dating. Despite being busy, they kept on meeting and within a year, got engaged.</p><p>The couple exchanged vows on June 22, 1996. On the wedding day, Candace was seen with a bouquet of white roses and an off-the-shoulder, lacy ballgown with a layered veil and a dainty necklace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/andace-Cameron-Bure-Anniversary-1024x1024.webp><p>Following their 23rd anniversary, the actress shared a picture with a sweet caption and revealed how faith was the main reason that glued their marriage.</p><p>The Instagram post read, “It’s the Bible. You know, when there are arguments or we’re compromising, it’s always like, ‘Well, let’s just go back to the Bible.’ It’s the foundation for us. So it’s not about winning or losing, but doing this journey together.”</p><h2>Three Children Together</h2><p>Candace and Valeri have been together for more than 27. Still happily married, the two are also a parent of three beautiful children.</p><h3>Natasha Bure</h3><p>The actress gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Natasha Valerievna Bure, on August 15, 1998. Natasha, 25, is often mistaken for her mother’s twin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Gushes-About-Going-From-Empty-Nest-to-Full-House-While-Quarantining-With-Kids-02.webp><p>Young Natasha accompanies her mother in most award shows and red-carpet events. Moreover, they even hosted the MovieGuide Awards together.</p><p>Natasha is a YouTube talent who is busy modeling, singing, and filming. She even took part in the 2016 season of The Voice but failed to make it to the final.</p><h3>Levi Bure</h3><p>Following Natasha’s birth, Candace gave birth to their second child, Levi Valerievich Bure, on February 20, 2000.</p><p>And from the looks of it, he clearly inherited the genes from his father. Not only that, but young Levi started his hockey career with the Odessa Jackalope, a junior hockey team based in Texas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/valeri-001.jpg><p>In 2018, he was revealed to be in a relationship with Bella Robertson, the daughter of Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty.</p><h3>Maksim Bure</h3><p>Finally, on January 20, 2002, the family welcomed their youngest member, Maksim Valerievich Bure. He is often referred to as a “baby” by others.</p><p>And just like his brothers, Maksim also plays hockey. The family of five is living a comfortable life in their mansion in Malibu, California.</p><p>After retiring from NHL in 2004, he spent most of his time with his family.</p><p>But after spending some time away from hockey, he picked another passion and opened his winery in California called Bure Family Wines.</p><p>Similarly, Candace even stepped away from the movie industry for a while. In an interview with US Weekly, she spoke about her choice, “I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom while my husband played hockey. I love the industry, but work is work. It can stop.”</p><h2>Professional Career</h2><p>Following his brother’s step and under the supervision of his father, Valeri commenced his ice hockey career.</p><p>Upon his arrival in North America, he proved eligible to play junior hockey. He joined the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League (WHL), becoming the first Russian player in the league’s history.</p><p>Then at the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, the Montreal Canadiens selected him as the 33rd overall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Valeri-Bure-during-his-professional-career-1.jpg><p>After turning professional, Valeri spent most of the 1994-95 season with Montreal’s American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Fredericton Canadiens.</p><p>Together with his linemates, Saku Koivu and Oleg Petrov, they were known as the ‘Smurf line” since they were under six feet.</p><p>After 50 games, Val was traded for the Calgary Flames in February 1998. There he recorded his first career hattrick against the&nbsp;Edmonton Oilers.</p><p>With his offensive ability, Val emerged as the leading scorer on the team. He lived up to this title more after the departure of Flames’ star, Theoren Fleury.&nbsp;</p><p>Bure was traded along with Jason Wiemer to the Panthers in exchange for Rob Niedermayer and a second-round draft pick on June 24, 2001.</p><p>With the delay in agreement from the Panthers, the former hockey player was on a brief hold-out from the training camp before the 2001-02 season.</p><p>After suffering a right knee injury, he was traded to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for defenseman Mike Van Ryn.</p><p>But another knee injury chased him down and he was returned to Florida after being waived by the Blues.</p><p>Later, he played for the Dallas Stars and Los Angeles Kings before announcing his official retirement from the sport.</p><h2>After Retirement</h2><p>Following his series of injuries and surgeries, at the age of 31, Bure opted to retire from his professional ice hockey career.</p><p>In 2007, Bure, with his wife, opened a Florida restaurant called ‘The Milk and Honey Cafe’ but closed it to move to California.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Valeri-with-his-wine-brand-Bure.jpg><p>After that, he fell in love with wine and opened his winery. To which he said, “I fell in love with the behind-the-scenes work and being able to start from the vineyard and put it into a bottle.
