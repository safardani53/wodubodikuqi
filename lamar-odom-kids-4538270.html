Namely, his son Jayden tragically <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passed away</a> at only six month old. Lamar also nearly died of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a drug overdose</a> in 2015, which affected his relationships with Destiny and Lamar Jr. Find out more about Lamar’s three kids below.</p><h2><strong>Destiny Odom</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lamar-odom-with-kids-mega-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Destiny, 23, was born on August 6, 1998, and she is Lamar’s only daughter. At the time of Destiny’s birth, Lamar was a freshman basketball player at the University of Rhode Island, just one year before he was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers. When Destiny was 11 years old, her father <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married Khloe</a> after just one month of dating — which Destiny has openly discussed in past interviews. “Things changed when my dad married Khloe,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;2017. “Things were a lot more public. When your dad’s an NBA player that’s already enough, but when he’s marrying <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a reality tv star</a>, things are so public that you don’t have a private life anymore.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Destiny’s relationship with Lamar became strained after the pro athlete overdosed on cocaine and ended up in a coma. But in Lamar’s 2021&nbsp;documentary film,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Lamar Odom Re/Born</a>, Destiny said the pair’s relationship has vastly improved. “I&nbsp;literally call him for advice for stuff now, because I feel like I can open up to him now. I can finally see what a real father is supposed to do,” Destiny said.</p><h2><strong>Lamar Odom Jr.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lamar and Liza’s second child, son Lamar Jr., was born in 2002. Lamar Jr. is now a 19 year old college student, and he’s been honest about his up-and-down relationship with his dad. In the documentary, Lamar Jr. said he could see Lamar “progressing as a person, as a man, as a father” in the years after the near-fatal overdose. “I do see him, kind of, taking that leap,” the teenager added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/lamar-odom-with-kids-mega-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>But back in November 2019, Lamar Jr. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expressed disappointment</a> with his father after learning the retired NBA star got engaged to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sabrina Parr</strong></a> via Instagram. “Not a txt or phone call to see how people who’ve known this dude his whole life to see how we would feel or react,” Lamar Jr. wrote on IG at the time, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>. He then deleted that message, and shared more positive remarks about his dad’s engagement, which has <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>since been called off</a>. “At the end of the day, I am a teenager, that is becoming a young man. I have to be responsible for what I post, I have nothing but love for my dad and want what’s best for him.” Afterwards, a source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that the father-son duo “spoke right away and they had a heart to heart” after the engagement drama.</p><h2><strong>Jayden Odom</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jayden, Lamar and Liza’s youngest child, arrived on December 15, 2005. Just six months later, on June 29, 2006, Jayden tragically died from sudden infant death syndrome while asleep in his crib. Liza was home when Jayden passed, while Lamar was on the road for basketball. Jayden’s death resulted in the couple splitting up, as well as <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Lamar sadly turning to drugs to cope</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>All these years later, the tragic death of Jayden has stuck with Lamar. The athlete spoke about his late son in his documentary, saying, “He was extra energetic. Whenever I’d walk into the room, he’d just stare at me. He was beautiful. He was like the combination of his sister and his brother. I just wish I would have had him in my life a little longer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uapJqqXaSxsLmMpKCdq11pgnSEkXBnaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
