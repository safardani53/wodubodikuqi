It's been awhile since we've heard from Teamiplier, a group of YouTubers who mainly created videos for Markiplier's channel. While videos are still being regularly posted to Markiplier (as well as Unus Annus), Teamiplier disbanded around 2018. For a little bit of backstory: Markiplier was started by Mark Fischbach and was originally run by Mark, Tyler Scheid (Apocalypto12), Ethan Nestor, Ryan Magee, Matt Watson, and then eventually Amy Nelson (Peebles) and Kathryn Knutsen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Around June of this year Matt and Ryan decided to quit working for me. The primary reason being that it was difficult to keep the work and the friendship separate," Mark wrote, stating that he was deeply hurt by their decision. Tyler and Ethan joined, and then soon after, Amy and Kathryn. However, in 2018, Kathryn left Markiplier, and announced the news on Twitter. Teamiplier has essentially disbanded, with Mark himself admitting that Teamiplier "broke up."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>MARK SAYING HE WAS DISAPPOINTED AFTER TEAMIPLIER BROKE UP CUZ HE EXPECTED ETHAN TO BE THE ONE TO GO ON AND MAKE BIG SHIT IM GONNA CRY IM GONNA SOB</p>— 10 (@0NCElNALlFETIME) <a href=#>November 3, 2020</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mark:" Teamiplier broke up"<br>Я: Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me</p>— tragic (@etgeer) <a href=#>November 3, 2020</a></figure><p>"While it is the end of our working relationship, we are still friends and I’m not going anywhere," Kathryn wrote on Twitter after explaining, "I no longer work for Mark, I haven't for a little while now and didn't say anything because I don't really use Twitter to talk about that kind of stuff but since this is my main platform and most of you know me from that job I just wanted to share so there isn't any confusion."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I no longer work for Mark, I haven’t for a little while now and didn’t say anything because I don’t really use twitter to talk about that kind of stuff but since this is my main platform and most of you know me from that job I just wanted to share so there isn’t any confusion.</p>— Kathryn (@verytiredkat) <a href=#>April 4, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I will always be thankful for the crazy year and a half I had working with Mark.

Mark and Ethen went on to create <a href=# rel=nofollow>Unus Annus</a> in late 2019. Although the premise of Unus Annus was to post a video a day for a year and then self-destruct, it still remains to be seen if that's the content strategy they're going with. The YouTube channel has over 4 million subscribers. Amy, who is Mark's girlfriend, continues to support Markiplier and Unus Annus.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Many fans have taken to Twitter to express how much they miss the old days of Teamiplier.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else have a random urge lately to just rewatch all the videos from the Teamiplier era or is that just me</p>— J just really likes Celine (@CelineSeer) <a href=#>August 19, 2020</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the recent years, Mark has risen to internet fame.

In 2018, Tyler let his fans know that his mom was diagnosed with cancer, and shaved his head out of solidarity. In June 2019, Mark posted a video titled "Some bad news," which sadly announced the death of Tyler's mom. Aside from going solo on Twitch (and YouTube), <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tyler is also an ambassador for Extra Life</a>, an organization that helps kids with health issues.</p><p>While it's unclear if Teamiplier will ever reunite, you can still keep up with the members as they embark on new internet adventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStnZGitrG4yJ6p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
