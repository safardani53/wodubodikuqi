I think if you’ve got flesh then it should be shown.</p><p>“Besides, you limit yourself if you are against all that because it’s part of the job really. But it can be a bit weird sometimes.”</p><p>Alica also said: “The roles I used to be cast for typically objectified women, so I was always being shown through the lens of the guy.</p><p>“It was nice to have a blowout and everything but that’s not really how I thought of myself or how I feel inside.”<br></p><h2>BOLD CHOICES</h2><p>Despite her character’s affair, Alice’s role in Belgravia — which concluded last weekend with five million viewers — is much more demure than the sexy vixen nanny who many will remember her playing in cult movie Sex And The City 2.</p><p>But Alice — daughter of Waking The Dead actor Trevor Eve and Holby City actress Sharon Maughan — is open to any role, even if it means substantially changing her body.</p><p>She said: “As an actor, you can’t be attached to your physicality.</p><p>“You’ve got to be willing to change it, whether it’s to gain weight, lose weight, change your hair, change your eyebrows.</p><p>“You really change yourself. I did a film with my brother which was set in the 1930s, and I dyed my eyebrows like Rihanna from that Vogue cover recently — they looked pencil thin, like ’30s brows.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000018425489-e1587854860580.jpg><p>And it was no different for her role in Belgravia, which is set in Victorian London. She added: “It was about an hour and a half in make-up and an hour in costume, so two and a half hours in total.</p><p>“I had to wear a corset too, and once it was on it was ON. You couldn’t really lie down and have a rest during breaks. You just had to power through.”</p><p>Alice hopes the drama — one of ITV’s most streamed this year — comes as a welcome relief from the unrelenting virus lockdown.</p><p>She said: “You can never predict success but it is zeitgeist, isn’t it?</p><p>“I certainly hope we entertain, because I believe my role as an actor is to entertain.</p><p>My character is a modern woman in a Victorian drama. She has the balls of a modern woman</p><p>“I hope we give an escape, because it is not the easiest time in the world.</p><p>“My character is a modern woman in a Victorian drama. She has the balls of a modern woman, and makes the choices we are all encouraging each other to make at the moment — bold choices.”</p><p>And when talking about similarities between Belgravia and Downton Abbey — both created by writer Julian Fellowes — she added: “I think it inhabits a slightly darker universe.</p><p>There is definitely more scandal.” Alice has told how seeing her parents’ success as actors made her want to follow in their footsteps, and she was always a performer at school.</p><p>She said: “I did know I wanted to be an actor. I guess I was always a little bit of an extrovert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000362044790.jpg><p>“I used to lift up my skirt as a three-year-old. I did get in trouble a lot in school. As much as I enjoyed school, I suppose I didn’t see the point at the same time, so that was a bit of stress for me.</p><p>“But I think that gave me the impetus to move forward. I had a maths teacher who told me that with a brain like mine I’d really better leave school now.</p><p>"I think she is the reason I did all right in school, because after that I decided to work and I got into Oxford University. She was called Miss Mold. When she used to turn her back, we used to go down in the chair and simulate sex.”</p><p>Despite her parents’ initial attempts to dissuade her from acting, Alice was never deterred from her ambition. She said: “For a period when I was growing up, my parents tried to put me off. ‘Acting is a terrible life, don’t do it’, they warned.</p><p>“And yet I saw the joy they derived from it. They loved watching plays and talking about them and their own performances.<br></p><h2>STAR POWER</h2><p>“The turning point for me was landing my first major film role in She’s Out Of My League [a 2010 romantic comedy]. I realised then that I was in the business and that film would be my life.”</p><p>Alice went on to wow in Sex And The City 2 alongside Sarah Jessica Parker, 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness with Benedict Cumberbatch, and in 2018 BBC1 Agatha Christie three-parter Ordeal By Innocence.</p><p>In 2017 her world was rocked by divorce from husband Alex Cowper-Smith after two years but it gave her life a kick-start.</p><p>She said: “I think that after the divorce I took my life a little bit more seriously, because you have to face endings in a way — death in one thing, but an ending in your own chapter.</p><p>“It’s so clearly placed there for you with divorce. I looked forward suddenly and was like, ‘Where do I want to be at 45? What do I want to have or not have in my life?’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000578675293.jpg><p>“You can kind of streamline a little bit. I think I valued my family a lot more and didn’t take it for granted. It was a rebirth.”</p><p>Alice has previously told how before her marriage she was never a big fan of dating, recalling of one disastrous encounter: “There was a guy who invited me to his birthday and then his cake came out and it was a big penis shape.</p><p>"I thought, ‘I’m not sure if this guy is someone I want to hang out with’.”</p><p>Though she is now one of the nation’s brightest acting talents, Alice has previously admitted getting starstruck upon meeting some big names.</p><p>When asked who, she said: “Probably Will Smith, in terms of star power, when I did Men In Black 3. He radiates it and it’s a crazy thing.<br></p><h2>'DON'T WATCH MYSELF'</h2><p>“And also he keeps your set going. People get tired and everyone’s standing around, and he goes, ‘Hey, everyone, how about a little rap?’.</p><p>“And he’ll just go into it and start rapping and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I could never do it’.</p><p>“There’s hundreds of crew and extras and aliens. He just keeps it entertained. You wonder how he does it, where his energy comes from.”</p><p>Despite stealing the show as Susan in Belgravia, Alice will not be binge-watching the series — nor any other.</p><p>She said: “I don’t tend to watch myself because I like to live in a detached imaginative space, and that brings me crashing down to reality.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN UK NEWS</h2></p><p>“I rarely watch anything in one go, I like to dip in and out.</p><p>“This idea of binge-watching sounds rather unhealthy. The word ‘bingeing’ reminds me of eating or drinking — teen binge-drinking, which isn’t a good thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000578469244.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000563846246-e1587855348153.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Belgravia's Alice Eve and Philip Glenister on the difficulties of acting out a dinner scene that takes a week to film</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvY22BeYWOm5yln6KWw6qtjJqjopuVYrK3sYyfo5qrmJ67qHnFpZysoF2osLOxxKdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
