However, these won’t be your usual collectables, as the band has hinted there will be something special about theirs…</p><p>The Blink-182 figures will be naked, as the band wrote in their announcement post, “Just 3 Nude Dudes”, accompanied by an outline of what they will look like.</p><p>You might be thinking – how can they sell these figures for a brand that can be for both adults and children?</p><p>Well, the collectables will be using the members’ instruments to cover any explicit details, just like their memorable What’s My Age Again?

One Instagram user wrote: “Thank you so much for this, my year is made.”</p><p>However, many fans can’t help but think this is the band’s soft launch of the return of a former band member, Tom&nbsp;DeLonge.</p><p>Tom left Blink-182 back in 2015 and Alkaline Trio’s Matt Skiba soon replaced him.</p><p>Numerous social media users have discussed their theories about Tom’s return. As one user wrote, “One step closer to announcing the return of Tom,” Another added: “That better be Tom on the right.”</p><p>To many fans’ delight, Tom actually shared the announcement post on his own Instagram story – which has fueled the speculations even further.</p><p>It would make perfect sense for him to be a part of them, seeing as they are recreating a scene from their Enema of the State album, which Tom was a huge part of.</p><p>One user, however, thinks that Tom will be included, but that doesn’t mean he will return to be a part of the band: “Tom’s in there because of course he is, he’s an iconic part of Blink’s history (celebrating 30 years of Blink). Doesn’t necessarily mean he’s coming back.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/07/GettyImages-82965577-1024x716.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matt-skiba-is-unsure-about-his-place-in-blink-182>Matt Skiba is unsure about his place in Blink-182</h2><p>Prior to this announcement, fans of the band were already speculating about Tom’s return.</p><p>This arose when an Instagram user commented on a post asking if Matt was still in Blink-182, to which he replied: “Your guess is as good as mine. Regardless, I am very proud of and thankful for my time w @blink182. We shall see…”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this interaction blew up social media, with users thinking that Tom was making a comeback in 2022.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote: “The cycle of Tom DeLonge coming back to Blink 182 is almost complete once again and it is a beautiful thing.”</p><p>Another added: “OMG it’s happening. Tom Delonge reunited with Blink-182.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/07/GettyImages-525781860-1024x804.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46tqZqumah6o63RpJyrZZGjsW6uy6KlpGVhbX9ursCnm6aZpJrAbsDOZpmeZZmiurC%2B05qjoquVmXqiv4ynmKSdlGKztrrKqGSpp6Co</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
