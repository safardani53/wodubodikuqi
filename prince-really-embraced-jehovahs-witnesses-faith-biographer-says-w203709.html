In the late ‘90s, he experienced setbacks and his bass player at the time introduced him to Jehovah’s Witnesses. He really embraced it. He definitely had faith.”</p><p><span>The legendary musician, who was found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota on Thursday morning, was baptized in 2001, and from then on, refused to swear in his songs.</span></p><p>Prince’s spirituality also heavily influenced his lyrics, and many of his songs have appeared on playlists for the U.S. visits of <b>Pope Benedict</b> in 2008 and <b>Pope Francis</b> in 2015, according to <i><a href=#>The Washington Post.</a></i></p><p>“Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life,” he intones in the opening for “Let’s Go Crazy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>According to Ro, Prince was closest with his father, </span><b>John L. Nelson</b><span>, and had an “optimistic” outlook on life.</span></p><p>“He was hardworking, open-minded and always just wanting to learn,” the author says. “He was also very generous, and open. And he had amazing confidence.”</p><p>Prince’s generosity extended to mentoring countless artists in the beginning of their careers.</p><p><span>“He would collaborate with some of the young artists at different times throughout his life, like </span><b>D’Angelo</b><span>, when he was first starting out,” Ro recalls. “Prince would work with the people who liked him.” Other entertainers who have called Prince a mentor include </span><b>Vanity</b><span>, </span><b>Sheila E.</b><span>, </span><b><a href=#>Janelle Monae</a></b><span>, </span><b><a href=#>Wyclef Jean</a></b><span>, </span><b><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a></b><span> and more.</span></p><p>And when he wasn’t working or in the studio, Ro says that Prince had a few unexpected interests.</p><p>“At one point he was very into film, before music,” he tells <i>Us</i> of the icon, who starred in <i>Purple Rain</i> (1984), <i>Under the Cherry Moon</i> (1986) and <i>Graffiti Bridge</i> (1990). “He had <a href=#>aspirations to work in film</a>. He also liked to play basketball. When he wasn’t working, he really was just a normal dude. But songwriting was extremely important to him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ50Z6YpaSpYrKurtGamp6cXZ%2ByqbvVmp%2BsZaeewa%2Bx0qycrGWWlra1tIyboKifopa9qbHRZqqasaNixHN8knBncmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
