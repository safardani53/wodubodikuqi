Pulido debuted on the music scene in 1995 as the lead vocalist of his eponymous band. That same year he signed a recording contract with EMI Latin and released his debut album, Desvelado. The album peaked at number nine on the United States Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and at number three on the U.S. Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of 100,000 units. The title track of Desvelado launched Pulido as a popular Tejano musician, but he was criticized by veteran musicians, who believed he was successful in the genre because of his father Roberto Pulido's established music career.</p><table class=wikibox readability=7><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Jose Roberto Pulido Jr, April 25, 1973, Edinburg, Texas, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Bobby</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Singer, songwriter, actor</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1995–present</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>4</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Parent(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Roberto Pulido, Diana Montes</td></tr></table><p>World Music Singer Bobby Pulido was born in Texas, United States on April 25, 1971.
