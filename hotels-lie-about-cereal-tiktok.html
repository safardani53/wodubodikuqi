While cereal is categorically regarded by many nutritionists as an awful breakfast choice, as most brands craft them out of refined grains and added sugars and they don't keep you full for very long, their prominence as a morning meal choice persists."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

All it usually means is you're getting a lot of bread, maybe some baked goods, fruit, and usually dry oatmeal packets and cereal.</p><p>While cereal is categorically regarded by many nutritionists as an awful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breakfast choice</a>, as most brands craft them out of refined grains and added sugars and they don't keep you full for very long, their prominence as a morning meal choice persists.</p><p>A lot of that may have to do with the fact that cereal is a pretty low-cost option that's easy to store and has a relatively long shelf life. Even though cereal isn't the healthiest stuff for us to eat, and continental breakfasts aren't all that, it's still a meal that comes free with our room while we're on vacation, and there are plenty of folks who take advantage of that.</p><p>But TikToker @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">khammer123</a> pointed out that some guests might be a little upset to discover the secret behind the cereal they're eating.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@khammer123 href=#>@khammer123</a><p>A little inside information for you <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=hotel href=#>#hotel</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - khammer123" href=#>♬ original sound - khammer123</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>It's not uncommon for a lot of continental breakfast bars to feature cereal dispensers that advertise popular brands. For the video in question there are plastic bins for Raisin Bran, Froot Loops, and Frosted Flakes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>However, in the clip, he reveals massive bags of generic versions of cereal. If you grew up going to Pathmark as a kid, seeing these will probably give you flashbacks of the "No Frills" brands of products.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>The TikToker writes in the clip, "They cappin to you. None of its name brand. It's all a lie."</p><p>There were a lot of folks who weren't happy that they were getting the "knock-off" versions of popular name-brand cereals.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>"These hotels make a killing. The least they could do is have some real Froot Loops. Damn," one person wrote. I guess most people aren't real big fans of Malt-O-Meal cereals.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>There were others who thought that the situation was one that could get the hotel in some type of legal trouble, mainly because of the misleading packaging on the cereal dispensers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>Some commenters pointed out that the difference between name brands and generic brands has more to do with the ingredients and potential allergen risks. If someone knows for a fact what's inside Kellogg's Raisin Bran, let's say, but don't know what type of stuff is put in the "knock-off" version, that could potentially pose a risk to them and their health.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @khammer123</span></figure><p>However, it's safe to assume that cereals are made in similar ways. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Great Value Brand Frosted Flakes</a> are pretty much identical to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kellogg's Frosted Flakes</a> brand when it comes to ingredients.</p><p>For @khammer123 it doesn't really matter what off-brand cereal he's eating though because as he says, "Yeah they all kinda taste like cardboard."</p><p>What do you think?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby1scusZKWhlWKuo7vUrWScnaKarq1506Kiraeb</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
