It was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reported</a> that he was ran over by “an extremely large piece of snow-removal equipment” that was owned by him as he was clearing snow from his driveway and helping neighbors remove snow that was left by a serious snowfall in the area. He went into surgery last Monday and was in critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Mr. Renner went to retrieve his PistenBully, or snowcat — an extremely large piece of snow-removal equipment weighing at least 14,330 pounds — in an effort to get his vehicle moving. After successfully towing his personal vehicle from its stuck location, Mr. Renner got out of his PistenBully to speak to his family member,” Washoe County Sheriff <strong>Darin Balaam</strong> said in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a press conference</a> shortly after the incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jeremy-Renner-Missing-Home-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“At this point, it is observed that the PistenBully started to roll,” he continued. “In an effort to stop the rolling PistenBully, Mr. Renner attempts to get back into the driver’s seat of the PistenBully. Based on our investigation, it’s at this point that Mr. Renner is run over by the PistenBully.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Just two days ago, Jeremy interacted with his fans online by giving an update <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>through a video</a> of himself at the hospital. The clip showed him being wheeled into a room with a Canon computed tomography machine, which is used for CT scanning. “I wish you all a very special night,” he captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5BvZqOdopq6unnRnqWnnaJiuqq%2F0qKloGWYpLqmecyeqqyZl5p6qbvSqaCtmZxirqSvyJ2cp6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
