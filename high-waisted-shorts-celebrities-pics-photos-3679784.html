She can wear her shorts in just about ANY style, but for the outing seen above, she wore high-waisted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daisy dukes</a>. The model paired the look with a simple white t-shirt and jacket, along with casual sandals. A small portion of her stomach showed between the teeny top and high-rise shorts, and it was the perfect warm weather look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/emily-ratajkowski-high-waisted-shorts-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Emily Ratajkowski</a>&nbsp;</strong>took a bit of a different approach to the high-waisted look. Rather than wearing jean shorts like Kendall, she stepped out in high-waisted biker shorts. She paired the look with a cropped sweatshirt, as well as sneakers and socks. The athleisure-style look was perfect for Emily’s quick outing to walk her dog on the streets of NYC. Bike shorts are VERY in these days, and a high-waisted pair is key.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/gigi-hadid-high-waisted-shorts-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Another fan of high-waisted shorts is&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>. She met up with her mom,&nbsp;<strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong>, for lunch in New York City during the summer of 2019, and kept cool and casual in her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daisy duke look</a>. The model paired her high-waisted jean shorts with a white tank top and clunky white sneakers. She kept cool with her hair pulled back into a slick bun, as well. With long legs like Gigi’s, high-waisted is a go-to style choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hailey-baldwin-high-waisted-shorts-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Speaking of legs and daisy dukes —&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></a> also rocked that look while heading to a photo shoot. Her high-waisted jean shorts came up above her belly button, but she still showed some skin by pairing the bottoms with a white crop top. Hailey accentuated her legs even further by adding a pair of heels to the otherwise casual look. Oh, and since she was out and about amidst the coronavirus pandemic, she made sure to wear some protective face gear, as well!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kristen-stewart-high-waisted-shorts-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>Kristen Stewart</strong> has proven that high-waisted shorts can even work on a fancy red carpet. She wore black shorts, which she paired with a cropped blazer. To dress up the look a little further, Kristen wore a unique pair of black and white heels, and had her hair and makeup fully done. Gowns and even mini dresses are more common on red carpets, but Kristen is never one to follow the rules, and she slayed in her high-waisted look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/halsey-high-waisted-shorts-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>As for&nbsp;<strong>Halsey</strong>, she stepped out while wearing jean shorts and a strapless, lacy bandeau top while out and about. She paired the look with combat boots and a hat, while also going makeup-free to keep it cool and casual.
