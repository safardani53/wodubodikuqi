Many sell with around 25 bids.</p><p>But if you happen to have a sealed, never before used iPhone, expect a huge profit.</p><p>These gadgets are consistently being sold on eBay for $10,000 to even $50,000.</p><p>One first-edition iPhone even sold for over $39,000 after a total of 28 bids.</p><h2>2. Motorola Dynatac 8000X ($1,500)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/2009-motorola-biggest-u-s-769545237.jpg><p>When the Motorola Dynatac 8000X debuted, it was the world’s first portable mobile phone.</p><p>While innovative for its time, the cell weighed around two pounds.</p><p>On eBay, the device sells for hundreds at least, but top finds are priced at $1,500.</p><p>One that sold for $1,278.48 had 38 bids on eBay.</p><h2>3. Nokia 8110 ($100)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/8110-matrix-426807799.jpg><p>This phone might not look like much, but it’s actually a relic of a bygone era.</p><p>Or at least, it made movie history in The Matrix when Neo discovered the item inside a package.</p><p>Because it’s a collector’s item, a trip to eBay with the gadget could find you $60 to $100 richer.</p><p>Most of these have around 15 bidders on eBay.</p><h2>4. Blackberry ($70)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/2006-file-photo-shows-blackberry-4104294.jpg><p>Back in the days pre-iPhone, Blackberrys ruled supreme.</p><p>Now the devices have become a collector’s item, and they regularly go on eBay for $60 to $70.</p><p>Many sell with 10 to 15 bids.</p><p>Just remember the actual amount you get from selling your phone depends on the buyer’s independent appraisal of the item and its value.</p><h2>5. The flip phone ($30)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/taken-internet-copyright-unknown-90159576.jpg><p>One phone that has not grown in value over time is the iconic mid-2000s flip phone.</p><p>The Kyocera Dura flip phones tend to bring in $20 to $30 on eBay, and an entire pack of Motorola RAZRs can go for $40, so don’t expect this one to make you rich overnight.</p><p>These tend to only get one or two bids overall.</p><p>Compared to their price when they reigned supreme in 2006, this is not really a profit, but it can lend you some extra spending money now if it’s just lying at home.</p><h2>Tips for selling your old phone</h2><p>Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that phones can be easily damaged.</p><p>So, like with any <a href=#>collectible</a>, the condition of the phone you have matters a lot.</p><p>The less used, the greater the value. Unsealed phones do especially well.</p><p>The phone’s societal or cultural value will also make it worth a lot more than just by looking at its age alone.</p><p>Most countries turned off their 1G networks decades ago, so this means if your phone was made before 2000, it’s very possible it will no longer actually work.&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, the value might just be in its appearance and history.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Comic books are also intensely sought-after collectible items, so we compiled a list of the <a href=#>most valuable ones</a> worth up to $75,000.</p><p>You can also earn up to $13,000 if you have one of these <a href=#>rare coins</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa4Jyfpdyb2iln6jBbsLApayampyaerG0zqecrGWimsOmrcuem2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
