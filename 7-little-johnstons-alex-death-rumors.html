They may have stemmed from a comment from a November 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> promoting Season 11 of 7 Little Johnstons. Emma was teasing the upcoming season when a fan asked, seemingly out of nowhere, about reports of Alex's death. The person wrote, "Americans saying Alex is dead. Tell us." Emma never responded to the comment, nor did she reply to other similar inquiries.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alex Johnston has faced health complications in the past.</h2><p>As documented on 7 Little Johnstons, Alex had his tonsils and adenoids removed several years back in order to treat a breathing issue. "The hope was that it would help him breathe better while sleeping," Amber explained in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clip from the show</a>. "However, we're noticing some physical changes in his body. He's getting numbness in his hands and feet. And so we still have some serious concerns going on about what's going on with Alex's health."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Alex ended up undergoing a sleep study, which revealed there were 56 times that he stopped breathing in the middle of the night. "That's a very significant number," his physician, Dr. David Wrubel, pointed out. "It looks like, based on the sleep study, he has what we call <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">central apnea</a> in addition to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obstructive apnea</a>."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dr. Wrubel went on to explain that with central apnea, the reason a person stops breathing is because of a problem within the brain or spinal cord — in Alex's case, it was because of spinal cord compression. Although getting his tonsils and adenoids removed helped with the obstructive apnea, the central apnea was a very real concern.</p><p>"Obviously, our anatomy is different than average-sized people," Amber said, referring to people with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">achondroplasia</a>, a form of dwarfism. "The base of our skull where the brain stem meets the spinal cord, the bone that surrounds that area is always extremely tight."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dr. Wrubel continued, “When this happens, the bottom of the skull, this narrowing puts pressure on the brain stem. When we need to breathe, this is what tells our body to take a breath. So when there is pressure on this area, it malfunctions."</p><p>Ultimately, Alex needed an MRI of his brain, which indicated that spinal decompression surgery was needed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Alex doing now?</h2><p>So rest assured, 7 Little Johnstons fans.
