It requires you splitting up and doing things separately,” Bentley, 37, told PEOPLE at his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Miles and Music for Kids </a>event in Nashville on Sunday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I took the girls to breakfast this morning. It’s kind of a drag because we hate being apart, but that’s just the way it is right now.”</p><p>But while bringing another baby into the mix has been a “big transition,” a laid-back Bentley is going with the family’s flow. “One kid changes your whole life. Two is crazy. [With] three you already know what to do so you don’t stress the little things so much,” he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“With my two girls, I was afraid every second they were going to fall down and cut themselves. This time I’ll be a little more, ‘It’s okay, you’re fine!'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bentley’s new approach to parenting doesn’t just apply to the hands-on aspect of daddy duty. Despite it being four weeks since their son’s arrival, the proud parents are still wrapping up some unfinished business on baby boy’s birth certificate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My wife and I liked the name [Knox]. It’s simple — my name’s one syllable. It just popped up and we stuck with it,” Bentley explains. “We’re working on the middle name — still working on it. We turned the paperwork in as just Knox Bentley, but soon enough … ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One thing that has taken priority in the singer’s life is instilling a sense of appreciation in his children. Bentley, who was on hand to lead a pack of more than 1,000 bikers during the eighth annual charity ride, planned to present the check to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt</a> with his two daughters by his side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I want them to grow up to be great people, to always be conscious of the environment around them and to serve in some way,” he shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He jokingly adds, “Hopefully this is one of my better examples they’ll pick up on — there’s plenty of bad examples of things I do for them to grab onto, but hopefully they’ll remember this.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>GALLERY:</strong> Say Cheese, Y’all!
