However, Christine and Ysabel were both nervous and wished that Kody had come along.</p><p>“I think his priorities are a little screwed up,” Ysabel said in a confessional while getting choked up. “And l don’t want to disrespect him because he is my dad and I understand, I do. I do understand why he’s doing it, it’s just really frustrating and really, really hard.”</p><p>While the teen admitted she is “super excited” to get the surgery done, Christine noted that her daughter was “<a href=#>really hurt that Kody’s not here</a>.”</p><p>Ysabel added in a confessional, “I think I’m a little upset that he can’t go because he’s always talking about how family comes first. But when it comes down to it, I need him there, and he’s not putting his daughter above the fear that he has of the pandemic.”</p><p>Christine and Kody, who married in 1994, also share children <strong>Asypen,</strong> 26, <strong>Mykelti,</strong> 25, <strong>Paedon,</strong> 23, <strong>Gwendlyn,</strong> 20, and <strong>Truely,</strong> 11. The duo, who have already experienced <a href=#>many ups and downs during</a> season 15 of the TLC series, <a href=#>announced their split</a> in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Sister-Wives-Christine-Daughter-Calls-Out-Kody-Screwed-Up-Priorities-0003.jpg><p>“After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave,” she said at the time. “We will continue to be a strong presence in each other’s lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family. At this time, we ask for your grace and kindness as we navigate through this stage within our family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kody, who is also married to Meri, 50, Janelle, 52, and Robyn, 43, shared his own statement via Instagram, writing, “Christine’s decision to leave comes with a great deal of sadness. We enjoyed many years together and I have a large amount of respect and admiration for her. Although we are moving forward on different paths, we will always remain committed parents.”</p><p>Sister Wives airs on TLC Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWTnb%2Bqv9OipZ5lkqe8uLrSZpuarZedwaa%2BjJyYpaSjYry2wIydmJ1lm6Sxur%2BMqamip6Kewaqx0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
