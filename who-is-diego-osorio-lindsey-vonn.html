In the book, she wrote, "I didn't like who I became. I had a tendency to recede, conforming to my partner's needs and preferences in an attempt to please them ... I wanted someone to love me, to make up for the ways I didn't yet love myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to her relationship with Osorio, the three-time Olympic skier — who retired from the sport in 2019 — was engaged to former fiancé P.K.

"I was cast in television and film projects such as HotSpot: A Guide to Finding Love, "Bronx SIU," Drug Mule and Roshambo, to name a few. I have also produced and directed several films focused on environmental and immigration issues," he told the outlet <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Muse by Clio</a> in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2013, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Osorio received an award</a> for best performance for the film Escape from Mondays at the Madrid Fashion Film Festival.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-is-the-founder-of-tequila-company-lobos-1707></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He is the founder of tequila company Lobos 1707</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Taylor Hill/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, he founded the premium tequila brand Lobos 1707 and currently serves as the chief creative officer.

"My family has been in the business a long time," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cool Hunting</a> in 2021. "I began to do research and found the story I wanted to tell: that my great-great-grandfather — who I share a name with — was aging tequila in Spanish wine barrels as he transported it to Spain."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "I knew that was a story that should be told, and could be told, and it makes sense in a marketplace, as well."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following year, he reiterated that inspiration to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Gotham magazine</a>, saying, "Deciding to create a tequila to honor my family and his legacy while still following my passion of storytelling was a no-brainer."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-his-tequila-brand-has-plenty-of-celebrity-support></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>His tequila brand has plenty of celebrity support</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Romain Maurice/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since launching Lobos 1707, Osorio has been able to count several famous faces as supporters of the brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he shared photos</a> from a Lobos 1707 event that included <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kevin Hart</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Adele</a>, her boyfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Rich Paul,</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Daniel Kaluuya</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Lakeith Stanfield</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=8>2 Chainz</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=9>Tobey Maguire</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"So proud of the table we are building and the pack along the way," he captioned the post.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-once-dated-bonos-daughter-jordan-hewson></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He once dated Bono's daughter Jordan Hewson</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2017 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Vanitatis</a>, Osorio opened up about his relationship with then-girlfriend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jordan Hewson</a>, the daughter of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Bono</a> from U2.
