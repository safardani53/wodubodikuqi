(The clip also noted that they had “caught Bruce in the car crying the same day the cover was released.”)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenner, 65, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>recently officially divorced</a> Kris Kardashian, 59, has never officially spoken out about his changing physical appearance, but sources tell PEOPLE that it’s likely because he’s a fiercely private person – not because he has anything he wants to hide.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Bruce has really no interest in responding to everything that comes out in the media about him,” says a close family friend. “He’s much more private than people think.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for why he’s undergone the obvious plastic surgeries, the source also says it’s really just about his wanting to remain young looking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The guy is getting older and doing what he can to keep a youthful look,” the source says. “Think about it. If you were a guy who is losing his hair and decides to get plugs or a transplant, do you address it with everyone in your life? It’s certainly not a crime, and he’s happy about the way he looks.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sources close to the show also say that Bruce’s appearance will not be addressed in the upcoming 10th season, which is currently filming and is set to air in spring.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He prefers to keep things private,” says a production source.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKO%2B1JycZqKVo7umvoyrnJqbpKh6tbuMqZ%2BorJ%2BotbC8z56bZqGeqby2r8dmpJqfka%2B2r7GMnKavnaJk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
