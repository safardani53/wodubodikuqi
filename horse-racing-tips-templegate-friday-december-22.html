WELCOM TO CARTRIES (1.20 Ascot, nap)
Created a really good impression when making his debut here last time. Trainer Paul Nicholls had him well schooled as he jumped his hurdles like an old hand. He hit the front a couple of times under Harry Cobden before just being run out of it by a more experienced rival in the final 50 yards."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Trainer Paul Nicholls had him well schooled as he jumped his hurdles like an old hand. He hit the front a couple of times under Harry Cobden before just being run out of it by a more experienced rival in the final 50 yards. The winner has gone on to run a cracker in stronger company at Cheltenham so the form looks decent enough. That was a really good start for this Irish point-to-point winner who should take another big step forward with that run under his belt. The third home from last time — Ideal Des Bordes — reopposes but he has 15 lengths to make up.</p><p><strong>IMPERIAL ALEX (2.50 Uttoxeter, nb)</strong></p><p>Tom Lacey’s six-year-old has yet to be out of the first three since making the switch from hurdles to fences. He kicked off this season with a third at Plumpton before stepping up with a big-field second at Warwick last month. He more than matched that form when going down in a tight finish at Newcastle last time. His real asset is stamina and he wasn’t stopping over a similar trip to today’s at Gosforth Park. Soft ground brings out the best in him too and there are few tracks that get as testing as Uttoxeter on heavy going. He has crept up the weights a little but still looks ahead of the handicapper.</p><p><strong>BRECHIN CASTLE (3.40 Ascot, treble)</strong></p><p>This son of 1996 St Leger winner Shantou kicked off with a 14-length success at Sedgefield on October. That was enough for connections to thrown him into the much deeper waters of a Listed bumper at Cheltenham last month. He came through that with flying colours, winning by more than two lengths. There’s talk of going back for the Champion Bumper in March and this looks a nice stepping stone.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).
