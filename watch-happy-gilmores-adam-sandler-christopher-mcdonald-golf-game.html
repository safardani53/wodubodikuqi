Let’s see what happens,” Sandler said while setting up his video. “I’m scared. Shooter McGavin, this is for you.”</p><p>The <a href=#>50 First Dates actor</a> admitted he crushed it, after hitting the ball on an empty golf course. “And I’m not lying to you … that was smashed. That went pretty well,” he said, before screaming into the camera, “You’re dead, Shooter!”</p><p>McDonald, 66, accepted Sandler’s challenge and <a href=#>shared his own video</a>. He took on the persona of Shooter, who was the golfer favored to win the PGA Tour before Happy joined, via Twitter.</p><p>“Nice drive, Gilmore! 25 years, huh? Let’s see if it’s Shooter’s tour,” the actor said as he putted the ball at his home. “Check it out. Oh, yeah. It’s all about the short game.”</p><p>The Thelma & Louise star celebrated a perfect shot, yelling, “Money!
