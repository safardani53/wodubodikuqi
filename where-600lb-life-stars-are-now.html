And over the last decade - with the help of resident surgeon Younan Nowzaradan, aka. 'Dr. Now' - there have been some truly remarkable transformations.
Fans of the TLC reality show were stunned this week after former star Dottie Perkins shared a selfie on Facebook looking completely different."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When I fall I can't just get up on my own, so I have to call an ambulance. It's really embarrassing."</p><p>However, he lost an astonishing 35st and met a woman called Sarah at an online weight loss support group, who he went on to marry.</p><p>Unfortunately, Joe, from Tennessee, later alleged that Sarah had cheated on him and the couple divorced in 2019.</p><p>But happily, he took to Facebook last year to reveal that he had married for a second time.</p><p>“I am doing well. For those of you that don’t know, I divorced my ex-wife Sarah after she had an affair on me and I moved back to TN," he said.</p><p>"After the divorce, I admit I did have a bit of a backslide because of the depression that was going on while I was dealing with the nonsense of the affair and the divorce but I got over all that after some time.</p><p>"After that, I reconnected with a friend I had known for over 12 years at the time and I married her and adopted her daughter.”</p><h2>Laura Perez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/laura-perez-792309853.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/laura-perez-792309850.jpg><p>Laura, from season seven, struggled with mobility issues at 42st and needed to use a wheelchair with an oxygen tank attached.</p><p>But going under the knife on the show wasn't the end of her problems, after reportedly suffering complications that led to four-fifths of her stomach being removed in a gastrectomy.</p><p>Following the procedure, the Texas native nearly died of pneumonia, but recovered to slim down to 13st, one of the lowest weights ever recorded on the series.</p><p>She split from her husband Joey, who she appeared with on the show, later claiming that he wanted her to stay at home.</p><p>"The better I get, the worse my relationship is getting," she said at the time. "I had told him, 'I need you to support me, not take care of me."</p><p>Tragically, Laura reportedly died aged 48 on November 17, 2021, with a local funeral home sharing an obituary online.</p><h2>Justin McSwain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/justin-mcswain-792311426-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/www-instagram-com-mcswainj2-792311394-1.jpg><p>Justin struggled to fit into a rental car when he first appeared on our screens in season seven, but his transformation since tipping the scales at 49st has been truly remarkable.</p><p>Within a year of adjusting his diet, the determined lad lost 23st and by 2019 was even taking flying lessons to earn his pilot's licence.</p><p>Nowadays, Justin has reportedly moved back to South Carolina, where he works as a graphic designer, and enjoys competing in 5k races and going hiking.</p><p>But he previously admitted to having ups and downs, explaining: "It’s a battle every day with food addiction, anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, and a whole lifetime of bad habits that need to be overcome.</p><p>"I hear a lot of ‘it happened years ago, these people should get over it.’ But it isn’t that simple.”</p><h2>Christina Phillips</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/708-lbs-one-point-married-780039894-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/708-lbs-one-point-married-780038873.jpg><p>Christina, from Mississippi, was nearly 50st when she appeared in season two, and recalled walking from room to room struggling for breath.</p><p>"I'm trapped inside this body that I don't want to be in," she told producers, adding that she hadn't been out of the house for two whole years.</p><p>She blamed her weight problems on her mum and husband, who she said let her overeat and often bought her fast food meals.</p><p>With a better diet, exercise and surgery, Christina went on to lose an incredible 35st.</p><p>She said her husband Zach wasn't entirely supportive of her transformation and the pair ended up separating.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It became clear that me becoming independent [from Zach] was not going to work for him," she said.</p><p>Nonetheless, since the split, Christina has managed to start a family, giving birth to two little boys, Ethan and Ezra.
