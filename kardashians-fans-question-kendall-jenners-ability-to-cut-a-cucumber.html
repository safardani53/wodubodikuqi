Kendall Jenner and Scott Disick‘s fight on a new episode of The Kardashians shocked some fans — but it was the snack she made beforehand that had other people talking.
“I thought I couldn’t cook and then I saw Kendall Jenner cut cucumber,” a viewer tweeted on Thursday, May 12, after a clip circulated of the model, 26, preparing herself a meal.
In the scene, Kendall starts awkwardly slicing the vegetable with the knife close to her fingers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Never in a million years would Kendall not invite me to a birthday dinner,” Scott said, noting that he didn’t “understand why” he was left out following his ex-girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>‘s engagement to <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>.</p><p>Kendall, for her part, tried to clarify that she had a “very intimate” birthday dinner <a href=#>that she didn’t want to make awkward.</a></p><p>“I am not saying [you should be left out]. That is none of my business at the end of the day. Making Kourtney uncomfortable is not part of my business. I am so sorry that that makes you sad and I am not trying to leave you out,” the California native told Scott. “I should’ve texted you, but I’ve been the one to have that attitude about it the entire time. Even the night they got engaged, I was the one that was like, ‘Alright, what about Scott’s feelings though? How’s Scott gonna feel?’ ”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In response to the Flip It Like Disick star refusing to see her side, Kendall stormed off, saying, “You won’t let me speak, Scott. You are talking over me. Please replay the f–king videos.
