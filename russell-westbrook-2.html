The brothers are very close and bonded over their love for sports.</p><p>The point guard attended a public high school called Leuzinger High School. He had an exceptional high school career with the Leuzinger Olympians.</p><p>He was offered a scholarship to join the UCLA Bruins. However, he didn’t finish college. He entered the NBA Draft after his sophomore year.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Russell Westbrook | Age, Height, & Weight</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The point guard turned 35 on November 12, 2023. He takes excellent care of his health and diet.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hence, he is very fit and in shape, and he is <i>1.90 m </i>tall and weighs 200 lb.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Russell Westbrook | Basketball Career</span></h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>High School And College Career</span></h3><p>Russell played high school basketball for Leuzinger High School. Although he was initially under 1.82 m, he grew to 1.90 m.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn’t receive many scholarship offers. Eventually, UCLA’s head coach offered Westbrook a scholarship. He played for the Bruins for two years before entering the 2008 NBA Draft.</p><p>In his two years with UCLA, he was on the All-Pac-10 Third Team&nbsp;and won the&nbsp;Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Russell is one of the most talented and aggressive players in the NBA. He can grab a triple-double in any game quickly. But did you know that his growth did not come that easy?</p><p>Westbrook was just 1.73 m as a freshman in high school and rose to 1.75 m, a little growth during his junior year.</p><p>Sources say he wasn’t athletic and could not even score well.</p><p>Russell joined UCLA for recruitment but didn’t perform matching his potential in the training camp. As aforementioned, Kerry Keating, the assisting coach of UCLA, caught the spark despite his ignorance, mistakes, and shortened height.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Russel was guided enough enduringly to get selected on UCLA’s roster and showed significant growth in height and performance.</p><p>Just to add, his mother is around 1.70 m, and his father stands at 1.73 m. Russell’s brother, Raynard Westbrook, finds him lucky to have inherited the good genes as he is only 1.68 m.</p><p>Russell’s growth spurt is either about the genes or the result of his hard work on the court. We don’t know that, but the growth spurt is impressive.</p><h4>High School Achievements</h4><ul><li>First-team All-CIF Division I</li><li>Third-team All-State</li><li>2× Most Valuable Player of the Bay League</li></ul><h4>College Achievements</h4><ul><li>2008&nbsp;All-Pac-10&nbsp;Third Team</li><li>2008&nbsp;Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year</li><li>2008&nbsp;Pac-10 All-Tournament Team</li><li>2008 Pac-10 All-Defensive Team</li><li>2008 CollegeInsider.com All-Defensive Team</li></ul><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>NBA Career</span></h3><h4><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Oklahoma City Thunder</span></h4><p>The Thunders selected Westbrook in the first round as the fourth pick overall. In his first season, he was on the NBA All-Rookie First Team. He also assisted the Oklahoma team in reaching the playoffs in his second season.</p><p>Then in 2011, he was selected for the NBA All-Star Game. He was on the All-NBA Second Team. He was again picked for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game.</p><p>Westbrook helped the Thunders reach the NBA finals that year. However, they lost to the Miami Heat.</p><p>Russell helped Oklahoma City to qualify for the playoffs again. They were also the first seed of the Western Conference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Point-Guard-Russell-Westbrook-Playing-For-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-scaled.jpg><p>Westbrook suffered an injury later that year which put him out for the rest of the 2013 season. Thunders were eventually eliminated, but the point guard became a three-time All-NBA Second Team.</p><p>He was selected for the 2015 All-Star game, where he was the All-Star MVP. He became the MVP for the second time in 2016.</p><p>The former Bruins even started the 2016 All-Star game.</p><p>He signed an&nbsp;$85.7 million&nbsp;contract extension for three years with the Thunders.</p><p>The father of three won the 2017 NBA Most Valuable Player Award.
