This is produced by a compromised blood vessel wall and often appears like “a berry dangling on a stem.” According to the website, the aneurysm may break or leak, causing bleeding between the brain and the tissue that covers it. This swiftly becomes life-threatening and needs medical intervention.</p><p>Clarke mentioned her brain scans during a health update, saying:</p><p>“There’s a lot lacking!” Which makes me chuckle every time. Because strokes occur when any portion of your brain does not get blood for even a second. As a result, the blood takes an alternative path to go around, but whatever portion is absent is lost.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emilia-Clarke-2.jpg alt="Emilia Clarke" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Emilia Clarke fought aphasia, an illness that impairs a person’s capacity to talk and communicate, after suffering from aneurysms. She also described how intense it was, saying she couldn’t remember her own name at one point.&nbsp;The Me Before You actress also discussed regularly vomiting and feeling “excruciating agony” as a result of aneurysms, but she claimed that Game of Thrones helped her get through it.</p><p>“Having Game of Thrones sweep me up and give me that purpose was very beneficial.”</p><p>Emilia Clarke came to Instagram in 2019 to post photographs from the hospital after undergoing surgery for her ailment.&nbsp;The Above Suspicion actress admitted to CBS Sunday Morning that the first time she had the surgery was challenging, and the second time, “I found it harder to be cheerful.”&nbsp;Clarke previously claimed to not be able to see herself in the mirror because her face was bloated with medications, according to news source Complex. She allegedly stated:</p><p>“I didn’t want to look at myself after my surgery. I had a lot of water retention from being in the hospital, and one part of my face was pretty bloated.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Emilia-Clarke-3.jpg alt="Emilia Clarke" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actress went on to say:</p><p>“I was quite ugly. What I can see now is that there is anguish behind my eyes. And nothing can compensate for it.”</p><p>Emilia Clarke established the SameYou charity in 2019 with the purpose of generating money to provide simple access to neuro-rehabilitation after a brain stroke or damage.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicpqGcnq5ur8uaqaSdXajCp7LEq5ydZZanvK55wauYoqZdlrumwdGyqqarXay1qrjEZqqhp5%2Bptq%2BzjKCYpp1dpLNuwMerpqedo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
