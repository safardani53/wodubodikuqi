However, because the house is a “bigger space,” Shauna and Rylee are likely going to need a third roommate.

More her than with you guys,” Mark says while sitting next to Tara.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/i-am-shauna-rae-exclusive-preview-tlc-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Shauna has wanted to move out on her own for quite some time now. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>HollywoodLife</strong> spoke EXCLUSIVELY with Shauna</a> back in February 2022 about getting her own place, and she was currently “working on the process.” She continued, “But because of COVID and because of my financial state, it’s just not something that’s happening right now. But it is something that’s going to happen in the future.” I Am Shauna Rae season 2 airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5BxZqJlkaJ6tLTArqWaZaKWsm680Z6top2nYsCprdSnmGaln6u2r7OMqKytZZ6axG60zq6qnmWjmq60u81maWaumZmysHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
