For his ability to instill zest and energy in modern gospel and worship, the singer, composer, and producer is regarded as one of the most significant Christian music musicians at the time.&nbsp;In 1989, Israel chose to dedicate his time to the Worship Ministry, and in 1995, he created the music ensemble Israel & New Breed. The group’s first album, New Season, was released in 2001, followed by Real in 2002 and Live from Another Level in 2004. Houghton produced Michael Gungor’s debut album, Bigger than My Imagination, which was released in 2003. In 2006, he published Timeless Christmas, followed by A Deeper Level the following year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Adrienne-Bailon-2.jpg alt="Adrienne Bailon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Power of One, Houghton’s debut solo album, was published in 2009, and the songs on the album were well appreciated by the audience. Love God, Love People, and London Sessions were his next two albums. In March 2012, he released a compilation album called Decade, followed by an album called Jesus at the Center in August 2012.&nbsp;He has received 11 Dove Awards, two Stellar Awards, and six Grammy Awards. Previously, the 51-year-old was married to gospel singer Meleasa Houghton.

The actress has previously spoken up about her struggle with infertility, noting that her path to motherhood was not simple. During an appearance on The Real, she said,</p><p>“I believe that as an audience, we should be aware that not everyone becomes pregnant straight away. I guess for me, I expected things to be so simple, but it hasn’t worked out that way.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Adrienne-Bailon-1.jpeg alt="Adrienne Bailon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She said that things will happen according to God’s will, which she believes. She continued,</p><p>“I suppose I looked at myself and thought, ‘I’m a Cheetah Girl, I’m 19 years old,’ and then I woke up and realized, really, I’m 35 in a few weeks, and that makes a significant difference.” I may feel as young on the inside and in my heart as I want, but my ovaries are what they are, and that s**ks to hear.”</p><p>Adrienne also said that she used to believe that since she had wide hips and was Latina, she would get pregnant if her spouse glanced at her. After numerous obstacles, it seems like the star is finally seeing her dream come true.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYnaqZmruvsYybmKKkn6N6orrDZqCsqpGauW60zq6eoayfo3qprdWeZLCdnJi8rrHDZquhnZmneqe10ayrZpuYnrmlew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
