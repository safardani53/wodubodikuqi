The two have not attended many public events like this together, so it was definitely a special occasion. Earlier this month, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pete supported Kim at</a> the premiere of her family’s new show,&nbsp;The Kardashians, but he did not walk the red carpet with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kim-kardashian-pete-davidson-cuddle-washington-dc-event-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Things have gotten serious between Kim and Pete fairly quickly. In fact, he already has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>multiple tattoos</a> in Kim’s honor, and even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got her name branded</a> on his chest. This is Kim’s first relationship since splitting from&nbsp;<strong>Kanye West</strong> at the beginning of 2021. The two are still hashing out the specifics of their divorce, although a judge did terminate the marriage in March, so <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kim is considered</a> “legally single.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kim-kardashian-pete-davidson-cuddle-washington-dc-event-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kim and Pete actually share their first kiss during an&nbsp;SNL sketch, and she admitted to feeling a “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>little zing</a>” during the PDA moment. “It wasn’t anything, like, a super crazy feeling,” she admitted. “I was just like…hmm…and then I was like, ‘Wow, I haven’t kissed anyone else in 10 years, maybe I’m just being stupid and it’s just nothing. It’s just a stage kiss.'” It wasn’t until a few days later, Kim said, that she realized she was ready to put herself back out there again. However, she didn’t share specifics about how the romance officially started — but she promised we’ll see&nbsp;that on&nbsp;The Kardashians!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FuZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjerGx055knZmmnrG0u81mm5qslWK7qrPHrWSwmaOdtq%2Bz06ilZpyTYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
