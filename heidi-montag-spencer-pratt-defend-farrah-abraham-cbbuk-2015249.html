Former Celebrity Big Brother UK contestants <strong>Heidi Montag</strong> and <strong>Spencer Pratt</strong> are lending their support to recently eliminated star <strong>Farrah Abraham</strong>. The Teen Mom OG alum and adult film actress, 24, made headlines earlier this week when she got into a <a href=#>physical fight</a> with fellow contestant <strong>Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace</strong> that landed one castmate in the hospital and forced CBBUK’s aftershow to temporarily go off the air.&nbsp;</p><p>But The Hills stars don’t think Abraham is to blame for the brawl.&nbsp;</p><p>“She’s had such unfair treatment all season long,” Montag, 29, tells Us Weekly of the MTV star. “They bait her, and she tries to make up with them and then they degrade her under their breath as a mom or a woman and whenever she stands up for herself, they call her crazy. They’ve had no respect for her from the beginning.”</p><p>Her husband of six years, Pratt, 32, agrees, saying, “She was the only entertaining part of that show. She just owned it. It’s awful how they called her ‘disgusting on the inside,’ and they just wouldn’t stop. How would anyone react to that? As far as I’m concerned, with the way they’ve been attacking her, anything she does is self-defense.”</p><p>Montag adds, “Farrah was totally set up. It’s not that I condone violence, but I completely understand why she’d react to these people because she has been bullied since the day she went in there.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple appeared together on the 11th season of Celebrity Big Brother UK in 2013 where they were named the runners-up. Abraham, who has not directly addressed the fight, <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “I will NOT be attending the @bbuk finale tonight! I don't wish to put myself in a potentially hostile situation #Cbb.”</p><p>She was also photographed leaving the hospital in a wheelchair on Thursday, Sept. 24. Earlier in the season she threatened to “straight up f—king kill this whole f—king house” after an argument over her flip-flops.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahnZmZtm65zqermp9dqL2musKeqWaoopbBtXnDnp2eppRis6K%2B0ZqfZpmSp66prcxmmpuapaB6c3yQbmltcV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
