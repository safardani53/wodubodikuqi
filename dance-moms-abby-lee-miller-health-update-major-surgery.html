Ever since the reality star felt pain in the back of her neck five years ago, it's all been &#34;downhill&#34; from there. She's been diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, and has had numerous surgeries. In April, she's coming up on her five-year anniversary of losing her mobility, causing her to be bound to a wheelchair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

My back is chronic - it hurts constantly where the surgery was," <a href=#>Abby</a>, 57, told The U.S. Sun in a new interview.</p><p>The former dancer underwent an emergency surgery in April 2018 after her doctor found lymphoma in her spine that left her paralyzed from the neck down.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Dance Moms">Read More on Dance Moms</h2><p>She's since had two other surgeries, including the most recent one she had done over a year ago.</p><p>"So, a year-and-a-half ago I shattered my tib fib (tibia and fibula in the lower leg) in a swimming pool.</p><p>"I was doing my aquatic therapy and I was walking up and down the steps. ... And then when I came down, I fell and I couldn't lift my hip high." Abby explained.</p><p>"I shot my tip fib - didn't even feel it. They had me on a morphine drip in, like, five minutes after getting to the hospital. That's how bad it was."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>After the "huge surgery," she spent 17 days in a hospital in Texas doing inpatient rehab before flying back home to Santa Monica, <a href=#>California</a>.</p><p>She joked: "Now, this is like a bionic leg. I don't know why I can't like jump over a building with this leg. It's crazy how many pins and screws and whatnot are in&nbsp;there."</p><p>On top of dealing with a shattered tib fib, the <a href=#>Abby Lee Dance Company</a> (ALDC) founder told The U.S. Sun that she keeps having broken bones.</p><p>"When you have 10 rounds of very invasive chemotherapy with spinal taps and lumbar injections and all that jazz, your bones get very brittle. They're very porous," Abby said.</p><p>"And so, I'm having the aftermath of all that chemo now."</p><h2>A DAILY STRUGGLE</h2><p>Abby has had a rough few years. Prior to her <a href=#>health</a> battle, the Lifetime star was <a href=#>sentenced to 366 days in&nbsp;prison&nbsp;in 2017</a> after being convicted of bankruptcy fraud.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, instead of <a href=#>being confined to a jail cell</a>, she's confined to her wheelchair from the moment she wakes up.</p><p>"Getting out of bed is like a whole physical workout for me. Just putting your underwear on and putting your slacks on, I have to do that all laying down while I'm in bed," she told The U.S. Sun while explaining her day-to-day.</p><p>"I have about 40 minutes of exercises to go through before even swinging my legs over to stand up."</p><p>Then, just navigating around Santa Monica is difficult since it's not as accessible for handicapped people, she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353399.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353480.jpg><p>Abby is still embroiled in a <a href=#>$15million lawsuit</a> against the city's Hampton Inn & Suites for <a href=#>negligence, discrimination, and emotional distress</a>, among other damages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353537.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353628.jpg><h2>GETTING HELP</h2><p>To make things easier, the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native has home healthcare in which her physical therapist comes to her place twice a week.</p><p>She's also doing occupational therapy, has visits from a nurse, and is taking medications for her pain and onset of diabetes.</p><p>Other than that, she does not have a spouse - her dating life is "nonexistent" - or close family member living with her.</p><p>"Everything is a workout - opening the refrigerator, trying to do the laundry, reaching down in the washing machine," Abby mentioned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353398.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353414.jpg><p>Since her "major surgery" from the tib fib, she added that it's put a setback on her recovery.</p><p>She tries to stand, especially while watching TV, but she's "not really standing more than a minute."</p><p>Her goal is to be able to get out of the wheelchair and revert back to using a walker, which she did prior to her leg incident.</p><h2>RELIEF FROM PAIN</h2><p>Abby tries to distract herself to "forget about the pain and forget about the chair."</p><p>When she's busy teaching or working, she says it all "kind of goes away."</p><p>"Even though I'm paraplegic and I'm in the wheelchair, I am not letting it hold me back. I was invited to teach classes all over the place," she joyously shared.</p><p>"I'm in Miami and then Texas and then New York. And then I'm headed across the pond to Scotland first, then Ireland, then into London.</p><p>"We'll just see how many times the wheelchair gets broken on the plane."</p><h2>LOOKING AHEAD</h2><p>After <a href=#>quitting Dance Moms in May 2020</a>, Abby said she "never stopped dancing."</p><p>"I teach on Zoom all over the world - Bulgaria, Romania, Mongolia, Israel, Spain, the UK.</p><p>"It's great. I enjoy teaching and I enjoy making the kids better. I even have some older students who never did acrobatics before or all that flexibility stuff," she said, while adding the age range of her dancers and YouTube viewers is from five to 85.</p><p>Abby spilled that she has aspirations to move to <a href=#>New York City</a> for a few weeks - "the number one most handicap accessible [city]."</p><p>She also is working on a new dance show titled Season 9 (she left after Season 8 of Dance Moms).</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The only details she's permitted to share at this time are that it's "about kids of all ages and drama with their moms," similar to Dance Moms, but "different and better!"</p><p>"You know, I want to get back to where I was. I've still got it," she remarked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/pics-video-founder-abby-lee-798353365.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/founder-abby-lee-dance-company-798353482.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWd9eYKUaJuappOaeq67zKxkmpqSrnqtscRmpKKknJq%2FbrTEmqOtoF2qvaWt055kppmapL9uv9Srnp6qqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
