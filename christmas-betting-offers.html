Three of the biggest and best racing festivals to track the odds for are…</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>King George VI Chase</h3><p>The King George is the second most prestigious National Hunt steeplechase event in English horse racing. It was first run in 1937 and named after the reigning monarch at the time, King George VI. Many of the world’s finest four year olds line up on December 26 for the 3 mile race.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the favourites to join famous winners of the King George VI Chase, such as Desert Orchid and Kauto Star, is Bravemansgame. The Paul Nicholls trained horse has six wins from 11 chase events and goes into the 2023 King George as the 5/2 favourite.</p><p>The odds, however, are close, which tells me this race is going to be a real festive treat. Look out for Gerri Colombe, Allaho and Shishkin to challenge for the £142,375 top prize.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kempton Winter Festival</h3><p>The Kempton Winter Festival, also known as the Ladbrokes Christmas Festival in 2023, takes place on December 26 and 27. The King George VI Chase takes centre stage on December 26, but there are many more races for the Christmas crowds to enjoy.</p><p>Some of the races to keep your eye on are the Kauto Star Novices’ Chase, the Christmas Hurdle and the Desert Orchid Chase.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Welsh Grand National</h3><p>The Welsh Grand National has bounced around over the years. Originally run in 1895 at Ely Racecourse in Cardiff, it initially took place on Easter Tuesday. However, in an effort to attract better runners, it was moved to February before poor weather prompted the decision to have it on December 27.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with Chepstow Racecourse hosting the Premier Handicap steeplechase, many top-rated four year olds line up. Previous winners include Burrough Hill Lad, who went on the win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, as well as Aintree Grand National champions, Bindaree and Silver Birch. Leading the Welsh Grand National betting market this year are Monbeg Genius (6/1), Super Survivor (7/1) and Nassalam (10/1).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darts events: PDC World Darts Championship&nbsp;</h2><p>A winner will be crowned on January 3 and, for 12 months, they’ll be known as world champion. The current PDC World Darts Championship betting odds have these guys tipped to win:</p><ul><li>Luke Humphries: 3/1</li><li>Michael van Gerwen: 7/2</li><li>Gerwyn Price: 9/2</li><li>Michael Smith: 11/1</li><li>Gary Anderson: 14/1</li></ul><p>Other hot darts bets for the festive season are Most 180s in a Day, Highest Checkout and First to a 9 Dart Finish.</p><p>The best throwers in the world all compete at the PDC World Darts Championship. The atmosphere at Ally Pally is electric from the moment the first arrow is thrown on December 15. The frivolities go right through December and into the new year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Christmas betting advent calendars</h2><p>Christmas betting advent calendars are, as you’d expect, month-long gambling offers that give you a surprise gift every day. These gifts cover everything from free bets and reload bonuses, to casino credits and free spins.</p><p>What’s nice about Xmas betting advent calendars is that you never know what you’re going to get. Therefore, you’ve always got a reason to log in, complete the necessary wagering requirements and get something special.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you should always gamble responsibly. Don’t risk more than you can afford to lose just to get a Christmas betting bonus.</p><p>However, if you’ve got the means to do it and you want maximum value throughout the festive season, make sure you check out the Xmas betting advent calendars at <span><a aria-label="bet365 (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">bet365</a></span>, <span><a aria-label="Luckster (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Luckster</a></span>, <span><a aria-label="PriveWIN (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">PriveWin</a></span>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>🙋‍♂️ Frequently asked questions about Christmas betting bonuses</h2><p>Finding a treat or two under the sports betting Christmas tree requires a combination of knowledge and timing.</p><p>As well as knowing where and when to claim the latest offers, you need to know how to get them. So, before you head off to fill your stockings, here are some final points to consider.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Which online bookmakers had the best Christmas betting offers last year?</h3><p>Some of the best online bookmakers for Christmas sports betting bonuses last year were <span><a aria-label="bet365 (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">bet365</a></span>, <span><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="sponsored noreferrer noopener">BetUK</a></span>, and <span><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Spreadex</a></span>.</p><p>As well as perennial performers in the bonus stakes, don’t sleep on UK betting market newbies such as <span><a href=# aria-label="BetMGM (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">BetMGM</a></span>, <span><a href=# aria-label="Luckster (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Luckster</a></span>, and<span><a href=# aria-label=" LiveScore Bet (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"> LiveScore Bet</a></span>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Are all UK bookies offering special betting bonuses for Christmas sports events?</h3><p>All the top UK bookmakers will have festive bonuses for sports bettors. Some might not have deals that are themed, but everyone has something to offer.</p><p>Some of the standout deals we’ve found this year are the £15,000 Winterfest challenge at Luckster, the Leicester City giveaway at Parimatch and the £2 million Golden Goals promo at BetMGM.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Why use Christmas betting bonuses instead of regular offers?</h3><p>Christmas is a time for giving, and the top UK online betting sites certainly do that. They enter into the spirit as much as anyone else, which is why the biggest bonuses always come out around Xmas.</p><p>Combine this with the fact there are tons of top sports events happening, including horse racing, boxing, darts and football, and there are Xmas betting promotions aplenty.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. When should you use a Christmas betting bonus?</h3><p>You should use your Christmas betting bonuses before the big day or their expiry date. Most deals focus on specific events, so they’ll need to be used before certain dates.</p><p>For example, if you get a free bet for the Welsh Grand National, you’ll need to use it before the race starts on December 27.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Are sports betting sites also offering casino bonuses?</h3><p>Yes, they are! Christmas betting offers aren’t confined to the sporting arena.</p><p>Virtually all of my recommended sports betting operators have <a href=#>online casino with Christmas promos</a>, which means you can play slots and table games for bonus bets, <span><a aria-label="free spins (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">free spins</a></span>, leaderboard prizes and <span><a aria-label="progress jackpots (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive jackpots</a></span>. It’s the season of giving and my team's recommended gambling sites certainly give generously in December.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">About the author</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dansmyth.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Daniel Smyth</p><p>Daniel Smyth has seen the online poker, casino, and betting industry from every angle.
