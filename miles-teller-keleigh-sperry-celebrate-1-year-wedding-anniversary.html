On Monday, the couple took a boat across clear blue waters surrounding the French Polynesian island, with Sperry sporting a floral headdress and Teller in a casual Hawaiian shirt.</p><p>The Spectacular Now star and the model <a href=#>tied the knot in September 2019</a> after six years together. Two years earlier, Teller proposed on a safari trip in Africa.</p><p>“I had our guide early in the morning tie a rose to a tree, [and we] walked up to this nice, scenic vista having coffee. She looked over and saw a rose and thought somebody had died. Which, whatever,” Teller joked of his big proposal plans on <a href=#>Live With Kelly and Ryan</a> in October 2017. “I said … ‘Today was the last day you woke up as my girlfriend.'”</p><p>Later that month, the <a href=#>Divergent</a> actor told Us Weekly that he and his then-fiancée were planning a destination wedding.</p><p>“It won’t be in our backyard so we’ll travel somewhere. But we’re figuring it out,” Teller said of his impending nuptials, which eventually took place in Hawaii. “To me it’s a celebration — it’s a <a href=#>celebration of our love</a> and expressing who we are to all our friends and family. … I know how to throw a good party!”</p><p>Teller <a href=#>met his future wife</a> at a party for the Black Keys in 2013 — and the rest is history. “He was so charming and charismatic,” Sperry recalled in an interview with <a href=#>Vogue</a> in September 2019. “I adored him from the first moment we met.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Teller, for his part, remembered a little more of a challenge. “Keleigh had caught my eye early in the night, and we talked,” he told Vogue. “I didn’t think it went well, but after a few more attempts, I got her to dance with me, and a week later, we went on a date. After we met, I knew she was the one.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more from the couple’s 1-year wedding anniversary celebration!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq4xKxkrZ2cobKzecqeo56hl516tLzEq6myZZOauaau0ZqrnmVhYsamrdFmrp6clJ67qHnAp6WirpWnwKK%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
