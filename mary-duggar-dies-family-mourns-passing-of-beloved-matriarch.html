Lots of tears being shed here — grateful for all the prayers!</p><p>Jill Dillard then chimed in as follows:</p><p>My heart breaks.</p><p>My grandma died suddenly today! She was an amazing woman of God and such a great example to so many! Grandma, you are greatly missed by all who knew you! She was a feisty, incredible woman who always took the time to talk about Jesus with everyone she knew!</p><p>I know she was ready to check outta here and get her new body in heaven before the old one started giving her too much trouble!
