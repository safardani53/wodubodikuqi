Those songs were "Call Out My Name" and "Privilege."</p><p>Fan analysis of the lyrics has led to the widespread belief that <a href=#>his new music is about Selena Gomez</a>.</p><p>So … did Bella Hadid listen to her ex sing about his other ex but still got put into the mood to take him back?</p><p>That’s really impressive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/bella-hadid-and-the-weeknd-1024x996.jpg><p>Fans of the couple will remember that Bella and The Weeknd dated for two years before breaking up in late 2016.</p><p>In fact, some felt that when Selena started dating him, she was <a href=#>stabbing Bella in the back</a>. (She wasn’t)</p><p>The Weeknd’s relationship with Selena is arguably a greater fixture in people’s minds, even though they dated for less than a year.</p><p>That’s probably because his name recognition grew thanks to his association with Selena … which in turn has led to The Weeknd getting accused of <a href=#>using Selena for fame</a>.</p><p>No matter what really went down during that relationship, though, Selena has moved on.</p><p>And it looks like The Weeknd and Bella are receptive to the idea of getting back together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/bella-hadid-as-a-model-683x1024.jpg><p>That said, there are always uncertainties with music festival hookups.</p><p>The atmosphere is very conducive to a what happens at Coachella stays at Coachella attitude. People hook up and then return to their real lives.</p><p>But it’s also possible that, even if The Weeknd and Bella are totally onboard with rekindling their past relationship, they still have some things to work out.</p><p>Relationships usually take work, and nobody’s putting in that kind of effort at Coachella.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Weeknd Drops New, Sad Music: Is It About Selena Gomez?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WBcMDHnmSwnZWgu6V5wKebZpqVobmieceam6KcXai9sMDTnptmo5mowKq6xmaYrWWTpK6ktMSlo5pn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
