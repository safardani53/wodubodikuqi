More so, the 44-year-old admitted that he is “nervous” as he did not grow up with female siblings. “I know <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>our daughter</a> is going to walk all over me — she already has me wrapped around her finger!” he said, before adding, “I’m a little nervous since I never grew up with girls in the house.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jesse-palmer-and-wife-emely-fardo-expecting-first-child-together-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>As far as her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnancy</a> goes, the 34-year-old told&nbsp;PEOPLE&nbsp;that she has felt “really good up to this point.” The expecting momma even admitted that she is a bit hungrier than usual. “I’m working out daily and my appetite has increased exponentially, which I’m not complaining about!”, Emely said. The expecting lovebirds noted that their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Aussiedoodle</a>, <strong>Lou Lou</strong>, will now be a big sister. “We think Lou Lou is excited about having a baby sister!” they gushed. “Every time we mention the words ‘sister’ or ‘baby,’ Lou Lou perks up and becomes very focused and interested in what mommy and daddy are talking about.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Soon after Jesse and his wife of three years shared the baby news, many of his 219K followers took to the comments to gush over the photos. “OH MY GOODNESS! Congrats ! can’t wait to meet this little peanut,” fellow&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;alum <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaity Biggar</strong> </a>wrote. In a separate comment, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bachelor In Paradise</a>&nbsp;alum&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Serene Russell</a>&nbsp;</strong>added, “I am so beyond excited for you two! the sweetest thing to see on my timeline today.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Just last week, Emely sparked pregnancy speculation after she shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a photo</a> via Instagram in a loose blue sundress. “Family pic! Loulou understood the assignment,” she joked in the caption. A few of her followers took to the comments to inquire if Emely was expecting. “Mama has an unusual dress on. Is the family expanding?”, one admirer asked, while another penned, “Baby bump???!” The soon-to-be first-time mom and the NFL alum began dating in 2017 and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> two years later. They eventually had a low-key <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ceremony amid COVID-19</a> in Jun. 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BxZqOdo6iybrzApaSeql2XrqPFjKCgq6RdmrqmuNhmnZqqlKR6p7XRrKtmm5ieuaV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
