She was eventually charged with third-degree domestic assault and criminal mischief, which are both misdemeanors. She turned herself in willingly and the district attorney ultimately elected not to pursue the charges.</p><p>"We are grateful that the Manhattan DA's Office acted quickly to end this matter. Now Grace can move forward without having to carry the weight of baseless accusations against her," Grace's attorney Ross Kramer said in a statement after the charges were dropped. "It's very re-traumatizing to be in the spotlight when you did nothing to put yourself in the spotlight."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2Bir8RmoZqakpa%2FqnnErZ%2BnoZOewbo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
