When she was 5 years old, she competed in the California Tropic Arizona pageant and became <a href=#>one of Toddlers and Tiaras’ most famous stars</a> when a face she pulled during an interview became a popular reaction GIF online.</p><p>“When Kailia was younger, when she was 3, she started doing pageants,” Gatterman said <a href=#>during one of their Toddlers and Tiaras episodes</a>. “She’s a pro when she hits that stage. She’ll say she’s nervous but once she hits that stage she’s a pro. She’s gonna beat you, every time.”</p><p>She continued: “Kailia has a very good talent. I mean, just completely amazing. I don’t know anybody that’s competition for Kailia.”</p><p>Following the show, Posey continued to compete in pageants and branched out into acting, appearing in the 2019 Netflix horror film Eli. In January, Posey announced that she would be a <a href=#>contestant in the 2022 Miss Washington Teen pageant</a> after winning Miss Lynden Teen 2021. “One word. Thankful,” the high schooler <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> alongside several photos from the event in February, where she was named second runner-up.</p><p>Last month, Posey’s coach, <a href=#><strong>Cambrie Littlefield</strong></a>, shared <a href=#>photos from a recent competition</a>. “HAPPY PAGEANT DAY! From me and my not so little anymore princesses!!” Littlefield wrote on April 8. “Swipe right to see their pageant glow up! Watching all my sweet girls grow up to be amazing people is the best part of my job.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Sunday, May 1, Gatterman announced via Facebook that <a href=#>her daughter was set to graduate with honors</a> in June 2022.
