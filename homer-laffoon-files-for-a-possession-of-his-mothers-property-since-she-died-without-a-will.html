Laffoon has asked for custody of his mother’s possessions since Anne did not leave a will before her death earlier this month.</p><p>People obtained the following documents:</p><p>“Homer Heche Laffoon and Atlas Heche Tupper are the Estate’s intestate heirs. Homer Heche Laffoon, the prospective Administrator, is an adult. Atlas Heche Tupper is a minor character. A Petition for Appointment of Guardian and Litem for the Child filed simultaneously with this petition, explicitly demands that the guardian ad litem be given the power to waive bail on behalf of the minor.”</p><p>Homer Laffoon is 20 years old and was born on March 2, 2002. He is mainly known as the son of Anne Heche and Coley Laffoon.</p><p></p><p>Homer completed his high school education at Campbell Hall School, according to reports. He is presently attending university to further his education. Atlas Heche Tupper, his half-brother, is one of his siblings. Despite his celebrity, he has never shared much about his personal life. For the time being, it is certain that he did not follow in his mother’s footsteps and pursue a career in acting. Following the loss of his mother, he told People:</p><p>“My brother Atlas and I would like to express our gratitude to Tyler, Noelle, and the whole team at Hollywood Forever for their kindness, compassion, and generosity of spirit. We are certain that our Mom will like the location we have picked for her; it is lovely and tranquil, and she will be among her Hollywood peers.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Homer-Laffoon-1.jpg alt="Homer Laffoon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Homer went on to say that Hollywood Forever is a location where people go to see movies and go to concerts and activities. He went on to say that she was his mother, but the generosity and outpouring of love over the previous few days reminded them that she belonged to her fans and now to the entertainment world for the rest of her life.</p><h2>Anne Heche’s cause of death</h2><p>On August 5, 2022, Anne Heche was involved in a car accident in Mar Vista, Los Angeles, when three automobiles collided. Heche sustained serious injuries when her car struck a home, piercing the wall and trapping her 30 feet within.&nbsp;Heche was rescued in around 65 minutes by 59 firemen. According to police, Heche seemed to be under the influence when the automobile collided. Blood testing revealed the presence of cocaine, narcotics, and fentanyl in her system. Anne was brought to the hospital right afterward, and her agent confirmed three days later that she was in a coma.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Homer-Laffoon.jpeg alt="Homer Laffoon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>On August 11, Heche’s agent indicated that she may not live owing to anoxic brain damage and that she was kept on life support to see whether her organs were donateable. She was subsequently confirmed brain dead, and organ donors were discovered on August 14 so that the organ donation process could begin right away.&nbsp;Her publicist later revealed that she had been removed from life support, and her cause of death was listed as inhalation and heat injuries, as well as a sterna fracture caused by physical trauma, calling her death an accident.&nbsp;Anne was well-known for her roles in I Know What You Did Last Summer, Wag the Dog, If These Walls Could Talk 2, Cedar Rapids, Catfight, My Friend Dahmer, and other films. She has featured in series such as Men in Trees and Hung, as well as the 29th season of Dancing with the Stars.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifqKWVp3qtrcWfpqimXZu2rbHSZp2oql2WerG70qycrKuZpLtuu8Vmn6KrXaK8tbTEq6pmqKKkvaa%2B07JkrKGemLJuv8eeZJ2hlZl6uLXToaaurF2Weri1y6Vm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
