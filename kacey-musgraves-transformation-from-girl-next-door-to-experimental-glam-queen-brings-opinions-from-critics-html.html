The Golden Hour composer's music is not the only reason she has been making headlines over the past few years— her plastic surgery has been the subject of media scrutiny.  
Although Musgraves has not publicly disclosed whether she has had plastic surgery, fans as well as some leading plastic surgeons believe she has been under the knife."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Take it into consideration that none of those surgeons have treated her.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>One of the three surgeons,&nbsp;Anthony Youn,&nbsp;M.D., F.A.C.S., suspected&nbsp;Musgraves got a nose job. He said: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her nose just looks thinner and more refined than it used to and the only way to achieve this is through rhinoplasty.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Dr. Youn further observed Masgraves'&nbsp;lips look&nbsp;different than before. “She may have also undergone lip fillers recently, causing her lips to look a lot more plump then they once were," he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Another expert, Dr. Dennis Schimpf, M.D., F.A.C.S., said the volume of Musgraves'&nbsp;face&nbsp;has a dramatic difference. Weight loss might have played a role, but&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Schimpf said volume&nbsp;reduction&nbsp;in the cheeks and neck has similar results.</p><p>“This can be achieved via injections of such products as Kybella, or surgically via excision of buccal fat or facial chin liposuction,” Dr. Schimpf <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He and Dr. Youn were on the same page about&nbsp;Musgraves’ lips.&nbsp;Dr. Schimpf said&nbsp;the Space Cowboy&nbsp;singer’s lips appear&nbsp;fuller and more defined.</p><p>Overall, the size of her nose and width of her nose is smaller, most likely due to a well-performed rhinoplasty.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Adam Schaffner, M.D., F.A.C.S., who is the Director of the Plastic Surgery Institute Of New York, also shared how Musgraves has had some touch-ups&nbsp;since rising to fame.</p><p>He said she might have used make-up, lasers, chemical peels, radiofrequency and/or great skin care products to get that luminous skin tone.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGikrquZmLaiuo6kmJydqWK6tr%2FGq5ivnaNiwbOtzaydqKqdlsGqu81mnaunnWK0qr7LZqWesKRisbC70WarqGWVrb2mvsimnKeskaF6qLjApmSqrZWau26u0aKloKtdpL2qusiopaxllqe8rnnCq6CtoZOoe6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
