And I haven’t really had an answer. But now, yeah, I’m thinkin’ I’m back.” Those words were never truer than on Tuesday (July 6) when Keanu, 56, was seen filming the John Wick: Chapter 4 in Germany. Keanu – <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CLICK HERE TO SEE THE PHOTOS</a> </strong>— is wearing his signature dark suit, was photographed while shooting scenes in front of Berlin’s Sacred Heart Church. While there’s not much difference in terms of looks between <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>normal Keanu and John Wick</a> – save for a finely manicured beard – Keanu’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>swagger</a> was noticeably different in these photos. So, yeah, John Wick is back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The fourth movie, set for a 2022 release, follows John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. The film received generally favorable reviews (73 on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Metacritic</a>) as it expanded the world. “John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns with a $14 million price tag on his head and an army of bounty-hunting killers on his trail. After killing a member of the shadowy international assassin’s guild, the High Table, John Wick is excommunicado, but the world’s most ruthless hit men and women await his every turn.” The film grossed $326.7 million (on a $75 million budget). It featured a lot of eye-catching stunts, including one sequence when Keanu fought on horseback during a chase in New York City. The pressure is on for director <strong>Chad Stahelski</strong> to top the prior installment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Keanu-Reeves-John-Wick-film-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I want to be cool with the action,” Stahelski said in an April 2020 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Collider</a>. “I want to be a better director, but that doesn’t mean I want to do less action or have less to do with the action. I guess the third one just felt like I needed a place to go after number two, and I had these ideas. It kind of became that wacky action movie. There’s been a couple days where I’ve decided to do number four and I’ve woken up in a cold sweat going, ‘Horses! How do I beat horses?’ I have no f-cking idea to tell you the truth. I have a lot of really cool ideas for the next one that I think are different and shocking and fun and unique. How to do them, I have no f-ckin’ idea right now. I’m still figuring it out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Keanu-Reeves-John-Wick-film-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before going overseas to film John Wick: Chapter 4, Keanu spent <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>some quality time</a> with his partner, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alexandra Grant</strong></a>, 47. The two were photographed walking outside the Spago restaurant in Beverly Hills, CA, after enjoying a meal from <strong>Wolfgang Puck</strong>‘s crew. The two joined Keanu’s Bill & Ted Face The Music co-star <strong>Alex Winter</strong>, 55, his wife&nbsp;<strong>Ramsey Ann Naito</strong>, 47, and his son<strong>&nbsp;Leroy Winter</strong>, 23, for the meal. It was, in a word, a most excellent dining experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49wZqSdkaPCbr7Enq2eq12btrO%2F02anoaekpMButs6hpWavmZi4bq%2FHmqetnaJigW68yJyqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
