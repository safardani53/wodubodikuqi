He also added a spiky wig and cigarette to complete the look.</p><p>Spungen dated Vicious until her October 1978 death at age 20 from a stab wound. Vicious, the bassist for the Sex Pistols, was charged with her murder, but he died of a heroin overdose in February 1979 before the case went to trial.</p><p>In 1986, <a href=#><strong>Gary Oldman</strong></a> played Vicious (real name: Simon John Ritchie) in a biopic called Sid and Nancy, which starred <strong>Chloe Webb</strong> as Spungen. Sex Pistols lead singer <strong>John Lydon</strong> (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten) later called the film “the lowest form of life,” but it has since developed a cult following.</p><p>Despite the real couple’s dark end, Kardashian and Barker’s looks received plenty of praise from their Instagram followers. “How?! This is genius,” wrote <strong>Harry Hudson</strong>. “THIS!!!!! 💀💀,” added <strong>Simon Huck</strong>, a longtime friend of the Kardashian family.</p><p><a href=#>The reality star and her now-fiancé got engaged</a> on Sunday, October 17, during a visit to the Rosewood Miramar Beach Hotel in Santa Barbara, California, less than one year <a href=#>after going public with their romance</a>.</p><p>“Both Travis and Kourtney are on cloud nine,” <a href=#>a source told Us Weekly exclusively</a> of the spouses-to-be. “The Kardashians, Jenners and Travis’ family are so happy for the two of them.”</p><p>The twosome haven’t publicly discussed their wedding plans yet, but an insider told Us that <a href=#>they’re already thinking ahead to expanding their family</a>. “They will have a baby together without any doubt, it’s just a matter of when and how,” an insider told Us.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kardashian shares Mason, 11, Penelope, 9, and Reign, 6, with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>.
