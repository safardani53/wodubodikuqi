It gets put to her, and it comes from Andrew Treneman (played by Jamie Glover), who she trusts and she loves, so she's willing to entertain it and to investigate it, and to see whether it is something that would be right for Waterloo Road.”</p><p>During the interview with <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Digital Spy,</a> she went on and explained: "They do go hand in hand because Andrew comes from the academy, and she's head over heels in love with him.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Waterloo Road">Read more on Waterloo Road</h2><p>“They're getting their second chance. It's a beautiful, beautiful thing, and him putting that in front of her means she will entertain it.</p><p>"Whether it happens or not...there will be lots of ups and downs in terms of it, as happens with real schools. But ultimately, becoming an academy means it frees you up to teach your own curriculum and so you've got a lot more control of that.</p><p>Last season, teachers and pupils in the <a href=#>BBC</a> drama series were not too keen on the idea of having the school become an academy, but the 47-year-old show veteran has revealed that the change will have its pros and cons as the eight episodes unravel.&nbsp;</p><p>Angela told the publication: "You've got a lot more money, you've got a lot more facilities, you've got access to so much more. There are so many benefits to it.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>“There are obviously negatives, and we will investigate and interrogate those over the next eight episodes.</p><p>"This is the ultimate business and pleasure, but there are negatives to academies. They're run by companies, and she's not a company – she's not corporate. Kim's not corporate, and the kids aren't commodities.</p><p>"It's rife for a good bit of conflict there, but there will be lots of to-ing and fro-ing. It' really interesting because, again, it's happening.&nbsp;</p><p>“Waterloo Road consistently reflects what's happening in real-life education systems right now, both emotionally and with the business side of it all."</p><p>When asked whether the romantic spark between Kim and Andrew would last, she disclosed: "He's not leaving her. He just kept leaving her before, but there is a lot of trust now.</p><p>"It's in a really good place for them in the beginning, in those first couple of episodes.</p><p>Angela added: "We have set everything up precisely so it can be knocked back down. Life isn't perfect and the academy is not a perfect model to go into. And Kim and Andrew, do we really want them to be happy forever?"</p><p><strong>The first episode of Waterloo Road will air on January 2, followed by weekly instalments.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/angela-griffin-revealed-new-series-868762054.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/angela-griffin-revealed-new-series-868762053.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGplZoZzhJVwZrCZpJq%2FrbvOZqmomZRiwLWt0Wapnq6Vlrm0ec2ermarlae2pr%2BMmqWgnZyWeqi%2ByJ%2BdoqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
