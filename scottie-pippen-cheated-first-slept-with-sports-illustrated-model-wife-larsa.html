And while Scottie has tried to look like the good guy here, claiming that Larsa cheated on him with rapper <strong>Future</strong>, 32, it’s looking like the former Chicago Bulls player is not quite the angel he originally portrayed, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The media site claims that friends of Larsa’s have come forward, revealing wild details of the couple’s strained marriage. They’ve even accused Scottie of cheating on Larsa FIRST — with a Sports Illustrated model!</p><h3><a href=#>Divorce: See The Worst Celebrity Breakups Here</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>“She says he’s been saying all the things about her that he does himself,” a reported close friend of Larsa’s revealed to the publication. “Like he told her he doesn’t want his children around a wh**e and accused her of being mentally unstable.” Whoa. The source continued, “<span id=ext-gen124>He’s trying to basically frame her as a bad mother because she had the affair.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>But apparently, Scottie is JUST as guilty in this situation. “He&nbsp;had the affair first, with a model,” the friend added. “A Sports Illustrated model.” Obviously the two didn’t have the easiest marriage, but now that they’re at odds and filing for divorce — also battling each other for full custody of their four kids — things have allegedly gotten even worse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In fact, cops paid two visits to their&nbsp;$11 million Fort Lauderdale home during the first week of October, on Oct. 1 and 4.&nbsp;A police report later obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>revealed that during the altercation on October 4, Scottie had smashed his phone in anger while Larsa was left “scared” by her husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“It’s a real nightmare,” the insider dished. “It’s like World War III and they’re completely at odds. He’s accusing her of being crazy.&nbsp;Basically, it’s really ugly. He’s doing the whole custody thing to try to use lawyers and do whatever he can to screw with her.” SO awful!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While no further details about this alleged Sports Illustrated model have been released yet, <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> is currently working hard to find out more.
