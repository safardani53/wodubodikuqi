We could not be more proud of the young man you have become. You are a blessing. Thank you for choosing to spend this important milestone with family and chosen family,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The photos included Gabe relaxing by the pool, standing on a surfboard, and enjoying a piece of birthday cake. Some of the other photos included him leaning down to talk to his mom and another family selfie.
