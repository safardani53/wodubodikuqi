One win in five games, nine points dropped, and looking anything but Europe’s premier team as they head to Saudi Arabia for the Club World Cup Championship."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fair play for hanging in there when many others may have thrown in the towel.</p><p>But really this was all about Suicide City. The team that used to have plenty beaten even before kick-off, now can’t finish them off when they’ve got breathing space at home.</p><p>An unbreakable backline has turned into one riddled with more holes than a kitchen sieve. Late equalisers have become the norm.</p><p>It happened against Tottenham, against Chelsea, against Liverpool and now, worst of all, against Palace.</p><p>They lost at Aston Villa as well…and needed a come-from-behind performance to see off Luton Town, most peoples’ idea of relegation certainties.</p><p>No wonder <a href=#>Pep Guardiola</a> hopped around in a fury on the touchline. Late on because he was convinced Bernardo Silva’s shirt had been pulled in the run-up to Michael Olise’s penalty leveller.</p><p>Yet even before that, with increasing frustration at his side’s failure to put it to bed in a&nbsp;game when every City outfield player who started the game had at least one shot.</p><p>To be fair, for 75 minutes the fact they were anything but clinical didn’t look like it would matter.</p><p>No Erling Haaland, maybe, but no problem either, and surely a morale-restoring win as they headed for Saudi.</p><p><strong><a aria-label="PADDY POWER WELCOME OFFER - Get £40 in free bet builder bets (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PADDY POWER WELCOME OFFER - Get £40 in free bet builder bets</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/celebrates-scoring-opening-goal-english-866690636.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-sun-22-23-match-stats-da200a8c-12e6-4777-9583-eb79f40048e2.png><p>Yes, they were facing their bogey side in Palace, who had actually won two of their previous five Etihad visits, but should have been little more than a speed bump.</p><p>As it was, all City had to show for a first half of total dominance was <a href=#>Jack Grealish</a>’s opener, the result of a magnificent stop, spin and slide rule pass from Phil Foden.</p><p>The finish wasn’t half bad either, drilled first time and low into the bottom corner of Dean Henderson’s net. &nbsp;</p><p>When Grealish bagged his third goal in as many Prem games you imagined that was the opening of the floodgates.</p><p>Although why it took VAR official Stuart Attwell over three minutes to confirm it, God only knows.</p><p>Yet as long as the lead was only one, Palace had a puncher’s chance. They just needed to start swinging a few, first – and when they did, they so nearly gave City a bloody nose, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/247ea4a7-5624-4370-85d9-878167021b5c.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-sun-22-23-heat-map-cutout-9f3b82c3-fdc5-4d7e-9f26-08e490b67590.png><p>It came when <a href=#>Olise</a>’s long ball caught the home defence on the hop and Jean-Phillipe Mateta reached it half a second ahead of Ederson, racing from his goal.</p><p>The City keeper stretched a leg to clear, yet merely upended the Palace striker. Yellow card for Ederson, and nearly an equaliser for Olise, whose free kick was a coat of paint wide.</p><p>A clear warning, then, that a second was needed - it arrived ten minutes after the break.</p><p>They had already seen one ruled out, when a whipped Julian Alvarez free-kick from the left curled straight in, but VAR rightly – and this time swiftly – ruled Rodri offside.</p><p>No matter, it was only delaying the inevitable. And, for young midfielder Rico Lewis, a first Prem goal as well, to add to the Champions League strike he managed a year ago.</p><p>Once again Grealish was at the heart of it, driving deep into the heart of enemy territory before drilled a pass towards Foden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/3d2f726c-4b34-49f3-bb4a-3b8954fead00.jpg><p>That pinballed up into the box and when it fell beyond a leaping Rodri and Joachim Andersen, Lewis finished like a time-served striker.</p><p>All over, then. Or so we thought…even when Mateta prodded in from bang in front after Jeffrey Schlupp drilled low across the box.</p><p>Surely they couldn’t, wouldn’t, let this one slip. What do we know, clearly? Because with three minutes of stoppage time gone, the unthinkable happened.</p><p>As Palace flung one more hopeful ball into the box, Mateta took a touch, Foden took a swing…and down went the Eagles striker.</p><p>Referee Paul Tierney pointed to the spot, VAR confirmed it, and Olise sent it one way as Ederson went the other.</p><p>Football, bloody hell, as Sir Alex Ferguson once famously said. Pep, you suspect, uttered something a little stronger…and well he might.</p><p>Relive all the exciting action below...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fJRua2xuX6Kur3nCoquyZaaoeqS%2B2KyrmqRdpa6trcKeZKWhppp6tK%2FOq5xmpJGpsrTAjKmpnqWZmr9uuMSanq6dXaq9pa3Tnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
