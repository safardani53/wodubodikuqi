But former England striker Peter Crouch has admitted that he had to put in the hard yards to woo his model wife Abbey Clancy into bed when they first started dating in 2005.
Model Abbey, 37, has revealed that she is a “freak in the sheets” when it comes to lovemaking with 41-year-old Peter — but she played her cards close to her chest following their first date in her home town of Liverpool where he played as a striker."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then, bang — I scored two and my hat-trick was Ab in the evening.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“You came over, and this sounds corny, but I have never seen a more beautiful girl in my life.</p><p>“I always remember your eyes. Your mum has got them as well. They’re incredible.”</p><p>She revealed that she was nervous about telling her parents, Karen and Geoffrey, that she was going on a date with a <a href=#>Liverpool player</a>.</p><p>Abbey said: “He pulled up outside my mum’s and my whole family were looking out the window.</p><p>“I don’t know why I was being so secretive. I think because I was so young and I was embarrassed to tell my mum I was going on a date.</p><p>“My dad is the biggest Liverpool fan on Earth, but I remember telling them when we had a few dates and he went ballistic.</p><p>“He was like, ‘I can’t believe you are going out with a football player. It is such a bad look.’”</p><p>But the <a href=#>Wag</a> was not treated to a lavish first date with the <a href=#>Premier League</a> star — he took her to his local so he could avoid the paparazzi.</p><p>Recalling their first date in the back corner of an “old man’s pub”, Abbey said: “I think you had a bit of an ulterior motive because when we got into the pub, Pete was like: ‘That is my bedroom window there.’</p><p>“I was thinking: ‘Hang on a minute, does he think he is going to get me p****d and take me back to his flat? Because that is not happening whatsoever.’”</p><p>Peter said: “It was not a great first date. But at the time I was playing for Liverpool and just got in the England squad so everything for me had to be low-key.</p><p>“I had to find a girl that I loved but I didn’t want to take you straight into something mad. I wanted to go where no one could see us and find out if we got on.”</p><p>Abbey said: “Well that little wooden stool in the back of an old man’s pub was perfect.”</p><p>She turned up at the date wearing leopard print heels with £7 in her pocket.</p><p>Abbey recalled: “Pete got the first drink, then I thought I would get the next one.</p><p>“I had never bought a drink in my life. I didn’t even know how much it was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/peter-crouch-abbey-clancy-wedding-85379017.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/abbey-clancy-peter-crouch-instagram-786995712.jpg><p>“Pete wanted Guinness. So I went to the bar, got Guinness and a glass of tap water because I was scared it was going to be more than £7.”</p><p>Peter described the <a href=#>model</a> as a “tough one to crack”, and Abbey responded: “Yeah, because I am not a complete ho.”</p><p>Turning to her husband to ask if he considered her “frigid” at the time, Peter joked: “Not a fridge, no.”</p><p>Remarking on what she is like in the bedroom, Abbey added: “Lady on the street, freak in bed.”</p><p>“Ludacris said it well,” Peter joked, referencing the lyrics “Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets” from the rapper’s hit Nasty Girl.</p><p>But she admitted that she realised immediately the 6ft 7in inch sportsman was The One</p><p>She said: “I knew from the day I met you that we were going to be together forever.</p><p>“Call that sounds corny but I did know that and I thought, ‘I don’t want to rush this.’</p><h2>‘You had a dirty toilet’</h2><p>“For me, it was important to get to know you first and know that this was going somewhere before I jumped into bed.</p><p>“Also, when we went back to your flat, you didn’t even have any sheets on the bed. You also had a dirty toilet.”</p><p>At the age of 24, Peter had moved to Liverpool after signing to the reds following a £7million transfer deal from <a href=#>Southampton</a>.</p><p>Yet despite his huge pay cheque and a call-up to the <a href=#>England</a> squad under his belt, Peter admitted that he lived like a “scruff” with no sheets on his bed.</p><p>He said: “I was in the Premier League, I was earning great money — like, ridiculous money.</p><p>“But I was living like a student because I had my same mates that were at uni or just starting out in jobs and they were living pretty much like scruffs.”</p><p>Recalling the moment she stepped foot inside his two-bed pad, Abbey said: “It was like going into one of the Inbetweeners’ flats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/liverpools-peter-crouch-celebrates-scoring-4001172.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/smash-hit-podcast-abbey-clancy-789679771.jpg><p>Peter added: “I just assumed that was how I had to live. I had all this money in the bank and I didn’t have anything to spend it on.</p><p>“I just lived in a two-bedroom flat.</p><p>“My gran used to come down and clean once a week, twice a week or something.”</p><p>Abbey said: “It was a gorgeous apartment block but I was just flabbergasted that he had one blue pillowcase and one pillow and a flowery one and then no sheet or bedding on the quilt.”</p><p>The grimy beginning of their relationship is a far cry from the lavish renewal of their vows in December last year on a private island in front of their close family and friends.</p><p>Speaking about the ceremony, which was held at a five-star resort in the <a href=#>Maldives</a>, Peter told Hello! magazine: “Abbey looked incredible, and even after 11 years, I still got butterflies.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Abbey, who wore a sheer vintage lace dress an veil, said: “We started as a young couple together, and now here we are with our four kids walking us down the aisle.</p><p>“I feel like the luckiest person on earth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYWZ9dXyWbGaampKaxm6vy5qlnLFdm7%2Bmrcpmqp6wXaWytbHRZpqrp6WYtXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
