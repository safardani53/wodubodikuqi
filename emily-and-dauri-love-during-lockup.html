So, who are Emily and Dauri in Love During Lockup?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Right away, it's clear that they have issues between them. When your boyfriend is in prison and still finds a way to cheat on you, that has to hurt. And from Dauri's perspective, making your girlfriend your power of attorney may not be the best move. There's a lot to unpack with these two, and something tells us this is the tip of the iceberg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Emily and Dauri from 'Love During Lockup'?</h2><p>Emily and Dauri met when Emily clicked on an ad for prison pen pals. She picked Dauri from a list of men because she found him to be the most attractive. When Dauri received his first letters from Emily, he explains on the show, he thought she was a catfish. It's safe to say that the attraction is mutual right away and they're even engaged now. But things haven't been easy for them.</p><p>Emily admits that she caught Dauri cheating by way of sending another woman letters. He explains that he only pretended to be this mystery woman's boyfriend in exchange for money. In the end, Dauri and Emily stayed together. And now, she says, she's in charge of his finances until he is released from prison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>She's also a grad student pursuing a career as a defense attorney.

Apparently, because of the pen pal cheating, she believes she deserves "an upgrade." She explains that, because she is Dauri's power of attorney, she can use his stimulus check money to buy a new engagement ring. Like we said, it's a lot.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This lady on Love During Lockup says her and her man are inseparable. Ma’am you’re dating an inmate.
