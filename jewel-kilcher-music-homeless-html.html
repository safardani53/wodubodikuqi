She recently recounted some of her darker days in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>The Joe Rogan Experience</a>&nbsp;podcast.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Jewel Kilcher Was Once Homeless</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the podcast, Kilcher revealed she relied on her vocal chops for some earning when she was homeless, but it didn’t always work out the way she expected.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She wanted to perform at a coffeehouse, but they were charging singers $200 instead of paying them because they had invited record producers, which would get them exposure. The coffee shop owner also took the door charge and only gave them the tip jar.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Kilcher, who was desperate, negotiated and asked for money from the sales of food and beverage, which the owner refused. She was so upset that she cursed the owner and her business.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In another incident, she revealed she noticed a coffee shop going out of business while living in her car. So she approached the owner, Nancy, and proposed a partnership.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The owner agreed to let Kilcher keep the door money while she kept the sales from food and beverage. Kilcher then performed on the beachfront and invited the audience back to the coffeehouse. At first, there weren’t many people, but it slowly grew until eventually, people lined up outside the coffeehouse to watch her performance.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And that was how her success story started.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jewel Kilcher Rejects Record Deal</h2><p>While performing, a radio programmer attended one of her shows. He ran 91X FM, which was huge, and during her performance, she noticed he was weeping quietly. After the show, he invited her to sing on his radio channel, which Kilcher agreed to. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her song got requested by fans so much that it landed her in the Top 20. After that, record labels started visiting her, and a bidding war started over her. By this time, she had learned a thing or two about the music industry, and she realized she had to sell a lot of records to pay off a $1 000 000 signing bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>She felt like having a bounty over her head, so she turned down the advance despite being homeless, but eventually signed the record deal.&nbsp;</p><p>And as the saying goes, the rest is history. Today Kilcher is a successful&nbsp;singer.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVrLKtecqio5yglad6rsHSoppmoJ%2Bisq2x0qxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
