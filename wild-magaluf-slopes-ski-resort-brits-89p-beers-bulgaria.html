Pirin Mountains, neon lights illuminate the strip and the debauchery begins.</p><p>Swathes of horny, raucous tourists descend upon Pirin Street, a 500-yard road that runs through the centre of the ski town.</p><p>It is where travellers can find a plethora of bars, two litre bottles of beer for 89p and more than ten exotic strip clubs.</p><p>At about 2am, Bobby, a young Brit from <a href=#>West London</a>, spilled out of Amigo's Pub with hundreds of other revellers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON BULGARIA">READ MORE ON BULGARIA</h2><p>"Stag, stag, stag," he heard from one direction.</p><p>"Shaggy, shaggy," from another.</p><p>"Please mister, come into my club I have a football team of virgin women waiting to meet you," he heard from a bearded man holding a juicy Bulgarian kebab.</p><p>Bobby told The Sun Online: "I've been coming here for about ten years.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"This is the first time I haven't seen snow on the street but f*** it mate, there is plenty of carnage to keep us occupied."</p><p><a href=#>Bansko</a> is about a two hour drive from the capital, <a href=#>Sofia</a>, and is surrounded by <a href=#>Unesco World Heritage</a> Pirin National Park that offers 30 miles of pistes.</p><p>About 230,000 skiers descend upon its slopes every year.</p><p>However, the end of 2022 saw record-breaking warm temperatures across <a href=#>Europe</a>, melting away any hope of snow.</p><p>But any time not spent on the mountain is made up for in the hedonistic haunts that are woven into its urban fabric.</p><h2>Mountain Magaluf</h2><p>If Brits find themselves stuck without <a href=#>snow</a>, they are usually found downing £2.60 pints before launching into routine nightly escapades.</p><p>Dylan Kilbride moved to Bulgaria two years ago.</p><p>He instantly fell in love with Bansko and its shenanigans.</p><p>He told The Sun Online: "Chaos, it's chaos.</p><p>"What I mean by that, is when it comes to bars there really are no rules, they'll be setting s*** on fire, CO2 cannons blowing napkins and there will always be a giant dildo behind the bar.</p><p>"It's also not unusual to see whipped cream getting licked off peoples' nipples, sparklers in peoples a**es, stag dos full of drunk Oompa Loompas... and drunk does not do it justice."</p><p>One of the draws for the Brit hotspot is how cheap it is, with one Bulgarian Lev worth 45p.</p><p>Dylan said: "If you have western money, the night is all yours.</p><p>"You can get two litre bottles of beer for the guts of a euro, if even.</p><p>"And in town, the most you're going to pay for a pint at a bar is six lev (£2.73)."</p><img

guide partygoers around town.</p><p>Word spread fast, and soon Dylan started the Bansko Bar Crawls.</p><p>They run weekly from January to March and usually attract more than 60 people from all over the world.</p><p>Dylan said: "In Bansko, you really don't know what you're going to get on a crawl.</p><p>"One stop might be a rock bar, next might be a live band, maybe a magician, acrobats all the way to sexy dancers... there's really something for everybody.</p><p>"The party area is concentrated into about 500m of road.</p><p>"So you have thousands upon thousands of people filling the streets on most nights... it's just chaos."</p><p>The top partying scenes in Bansko include Jack’s House, Flash Club, The Club Bansko, Oxygen Club, Amigo's and Queens pub.</p><p>While the small Bulgarian town might not compare to <a href=#>Austria's party capital Ischgl</a>, the little village still packs a punch.</p><p>Dylan said: "I don't know if I would compare it to the recklessness of <a href=#>Magaluf</a> but it is party on snow for sure.</p><p>"Everyone has fun here, they ski, they get drunk, and its rinse and repeat for six days."</p><p>Those seeking after-hours attractions are also well catered for.</p><p>Dylan said: "Off the top of my head, if you drew a 500m radius around the middle of town you could probably spit at five or six strip clubs if not more."</p><h2>White powder</h2><p>Amid the mayhem, partygoers could almost forget the reason Bankso became a resort - the snow.</p><p>Across Europe, Bansko consistently offers among the best value for money, according to reviews.</p><p>The highest point of the ski centre is 8,398ft and from there 46 miles of powdered runs extend to the village.</p><p>In a good season, the longest of its 16 runs stretches about ten miles.</p><p>Dylan said: "Bulgaria as a country is epic.</p><p>"And Bansko would be its snow town mecca.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN
