She is one of these people who is just born an athlete. She is just incredible and sweet and nice as she could be. She was in the only woman in the group. Didn’t faze her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He later added, “Who wouldn’t want to play a round with Lexi Thompson? She’s just excellent. She’s superb… She’s got so much energy on her swing, she rises up on her tiptoes when she hits off the tee – and let me just say, she works out. I want to avoid any kind of sexist connotation here. But she was… it’s understandable why she’s such an accomplished professional.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0mieqKSWmr9uuMSxoGasmKS6sb%2FOp2SlnZGrsrR50qiaopmcYrqmsMiaZKCnnJt6tb7Upqdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
