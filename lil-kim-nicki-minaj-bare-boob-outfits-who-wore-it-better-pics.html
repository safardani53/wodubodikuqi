Kim let her breast hang out at the 1999 VMAs when she wore a light purple, sequined, jumpsuit with an asymmetrical-neckline that covered up one of her perky breasts, while the other sported only a seashell-shaped pastie over her nipple."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She completed the ensemble with a matching purple wig, but honestly all eyes were on the boob! Even in that moment we knew her look was gonna go down in fashion history, which is why we immediately thought of it when Nicki showed up at Paris Fashion Week in a boob-baring outfit of her own.</p><h3>Nicki Minaj Vs.

Nicki wore an asymmetrical black blazer that covered up one side of her chest, with a shiny diamond shaped pastie over her left breast. The singer also wore purple sunglasses, dark green shorts, and laced-up heels, but again, no one really noticed those accessories.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think made Nicki or Kim’s bare boob look the best?
