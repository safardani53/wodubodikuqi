It emerged that the world-famous illustrator's ancestors may have hailed from little Norton Disney in Lincolnshire.
Disney visited the rural hamlet, which has a population of just 240, in 1949 and discovered his family’s coat of arms on a 14th-century tomb.
Disney then secretly honoured the village by incorporating the coat within flags that fly from the famous castle in its films’ title sequences."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’ve got no facilities, whatsoever.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Disney">Read More on Disney</h2><p>“It’s great that Walt came but it was a long time ago and I don’t think we need to make a song and dance about it.</p><p>“Tourists coming would shatter the peace and they’d leave litter everywhere.</p><p>“I think the whole Disney connection is a bit far-fetched really. It’s all quite tenuous but some people seem to really want to make the most of it.”</p><p>Disney stopped at the village, near Newark, while on his way to <a href=#>Scotland</a> in 1949, after being intrigued as to why it bore his surname.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>He learned that the French De Isnigy family had settled in the area after the 1066 <a href=#>Battle of Hastings</a>, with the name changing to Disney by the 14th century.</p><p>At the village’s St Peter's Church he discovered the family’s crest, on the medieval tomb of Sir William d'Isney.</p><p>The coat - featuring three lions - has been reproduced on every Disney castle, and since 2006 the <a href=#>film</a> titles have shown three lions on the castle.</p><p>Rev Jim Rooke, 79, who has lived in Norton Disney since 1978, warned Disney fans they might find themselves disappointed.</p><p>He said: “This has put the village on the map - but it’s a bit of a dead village, really.</p><p>“We’ve got a pub that opens five days a week and that’s about it.</p><p>“There’s no shop, the <a href=#>Post Office</a> has long gone and there’s not even a bus service.</p><p>“We’re about right with the tourism we get.&nbsp; We get visitors coming to walk the footpaths and so on.</p><p>“I don’t think we could necessarily cope with more.</p><p>“I wouldn’t want to see the village Disneyfied. We put bright lights up at <a href=#>Christmas</a> - but that’s about it.”</p><p>At the church, Disney fans Donna Southon, 48, and dad Eddie, 87, detoured while on holiday in Lincolnshire after reading about the village’s links.</p><p>Donna, of Royston, Herts, said: “We’re here on holiday and we didn’t really know about this place until we saw the news.</p><p>“It’s incredible that he has been here and this is where he got the idea from.</p><p>“All my nieces and nephews are Disney fans as well, so I wanted to take a few pictures to show them.”</p><p>Eddie, from Bedford, Beds, added: “I couldn’t believe it. All the time I’ve been to Norton Disney and I didn’t realise there was such a <a href=#>history</a> with the Walt Disney family.</p><p>“The village should do more to make it known but I suppose it’s not really set up for tourists.</p><p>“They probably don’t want a lot of people turning up in cars. The pub would be pleased about it but perhaps the locals want to keep the place to themselves.”</p><p>Walt Disney’s nod to Norton Disney can be seen at the company’s six <a href=#>theme parks</a>. Main Street, the village’s central road, shares its name with a thoroughfare at <a href=#>Disneyland</a>.</p><p>Home footage held by the Walt Disney Family Museum in <a href=#>San Francisco</a> shows Walt and his family walking down Main Street and posing near the village signs.</p><p>He donated signed sketches of characters including <a href=#>Pinocchio</a>, <a href=#>Snow White</a> and Jiminy Cricket, on display in the village hall.</p><p>Norton Disney resident Chris Yarnell said some residents are discussing ways to further celebrate their Disney links.</p><p>One suggestion is to seek permission to use the Disney logo or characters on signs entering the village.</p><p>Chris, a self-confessed Disney fan who has visited its theme parks 11 times, said: “There is a will to do something, definitely.</p><p>“But there’s probably an equal amount of people that like their own lives, keep their heads down and mow the grass.</p><p>“But you will find that everywhere.</p><p>“It’s a difficult balance, I suppose.”</p><p>Chris, 65, added: “My wife and I are big Disney fans. We’ve been to <a href=#>Florida</a> many times.</p><p>“It was a coincidence that we moved here but when we were doing research online we found that there was this tenuous connection to Walt Disney.”</p><p>To celebrate the centenary, Disney has presented the village with a specially commissioned picture of <a href=#>Mickey and Minnie Mouse</a> walking through Norton Disney, drawn by company illustrator Kim Raymond.</p><p>Historian Sebastien Durand said it is impossible to prove whether Walt Disney was 100 per cent related to the Disneys of Norton Disney but that it is highly likely.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He told the <a href=#>BBC</a>: “We know that the Disney name began in <a href=#>France</a>, continued in <a href=#>England</a> and went to <a href=#>Ireland</a> and then to <a href=#>America</a>, so obviously all people who share that name Disney, including Walt Disney, share that same history.</p><p>"Nobody can trace a direct history over 1,000 years except if he is from a <a href=#>royal family</a>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chris-yarnell-disneys-secret-tribute-853364771.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tomb-sir-william-disney-baring-853364673.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000853364769.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/adbaffe7-ea35-4a03-bc9d-cb8659f04bb2-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F1gZZpbW9no5qws7HTZpuiq56axm7CyKWjmp%2BVYrmqusKoo6ermJ6%2FpnnNqGSvoaOewbC%2B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
