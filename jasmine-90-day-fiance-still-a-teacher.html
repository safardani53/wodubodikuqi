He sent partial nude photos that she gave to him out of confidence to one of his exes, who then threatened to release those photos."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When a follower asked what he does for work right now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jasmine replied</a>, "I'm currently supporting myself and my kids with OnlyFans and Cameos. I'm trying to get a new job. I haven't had good luck yet."</p><p>And right now, it looks like Jasmine is still making money through those modes of work rather than teaching. It's possible that either Gino's ex did leak the photos of Jasmine, or being on the show itself caused her to lose her job.</p><p>90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days has a way of showing the worst in its cast members. And even if Jasmine does love Gino, her participation in the show could be partly to blame for why she isn't a teacher anymore.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @jasminepanama</a></figure><p>Jasmine does have a few dozen reviews on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameo</a>, however, so she could be making decent money there at this time. You can order a personal video for $50 or shell out $105 for a video you can use for your business.</p><p>And, as Jasmine said on Instagram, she currently has an OnlyFans account, where her subscribers can pay $14.99 per month for her content.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Jasmine and Gino still together after '90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days'?</h2><p>Per the standard NDAs in place for 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days cast members, neither Gino or Jasmine has revealed if they're still together. However, judging by Gino's numerous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> posts with Jasmine, it seems like they still are.</p><p>The photos are captioned with "throwback" hashtags, but if Gino and Jasmine were no longer together, he probably wouldn't be so eager to share the pictures in the first place.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gino Palazzolo (@gpalazz2)</a></p></figure><p>Jasmine spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in February 2022 and admitted that Gino is a "nice man" and that his heart was in the right place with her during their first meeting and trip in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Season 5.
