Avery is an incredibly talented musician and could go win it all. However, he has to beat out 10 other contestants in the two-night season finale event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, who is Avery Dixon? At just the age of 21, Avery has already accomplished so much. Learn more about the young saxophonist as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AGT season 17</a> comes to an end and a winner is crowned!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/avery-dixon-5-things-to-know-embed.jpg><h2>1. Avery got the first AGT Golden Buzzer of season 17.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Avery wowed the judges and audience with his incredible saxophone skills during his audition. “You will change the world,” <strong>Howie Mandel</strong> declared. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></a> said this is Avery’s “destiny.” Host <strong>Terry Crews</strong> was so impressed that he gave Avery the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first Golden Buzzer of the season</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Avery wanted to learn how to play an instrument and picked out the saxophone while he was in the store. He was a natural from the beginning and learned how to play “harder songs within the first month of playing,” according to a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2013 interview</a>. Avery received a letter from <strong>President Obama</strong> congratulating him on his musical accomplishments.</p><h2>2. Avery was ‘not expected to live’ when he was born.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Avery was born 24 weeks premature and weighed only 1 lb. 8 oz. He was “not expected to live,” according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>official bio</a>. “His little finger wouldn’t even wrap completely around my pointer finger,” his mother,<strong> Lisa</strong>, said in 2013. He has released an EP titled Entrees.</p><h2>3. Avery’s voice was impacted by his long stay in the hospital.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Avery spent 39 days with a tube down his throat that kept him alive. The tube left a small hole in Avery’s vocal cords. This causes his voice “to be pitchy and airy because his vocal cords do not close completely,” according to his bio. This complicates his asthma and makes it difficult for him to breathe at times.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>He revealed to the judges that he was bullied when he was younger. “I was in such a dark place I actually wanted to commit suicide,” Avery admitted. Just before giving Avery the Golden Buzzer, Terry told the musician to tell his bullies that he’s got a “big brother named Terry Crews” who will always have his back.</p><h2>4. Avery shows off his musical talent on social media.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Avery frequently posts videos of himself playing the saxophone on Instagram and TikTok. He covers songs by <strong>Alicia Keys</strong>, <strong>Boyz II Men</strong>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Legend</strong></a>. He gives inside glimpses of his performances at weddings, festivals, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/avery-dixon-americas-got-talent-nbc-embed.jpg><h2>5. Avery is following in his great-grandfather’s footsteps.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Avery’s great-grandfather was <strong>Maxwell Davis</strong>. Maxwell was an R&B saxophonist, arranger, and record producer. He worked with artists like <strong>BB King</strong>, <strong>Etta James</strong>, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kut7HRsmSdoaiku26txq1krJ2RqLyveZBwZG1vZWh9c4OO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
